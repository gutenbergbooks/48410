<h2 id="c1">CHAPTER I.
<br /><span class="small">THE TRAIL UP CEDAR HILL.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;<i>How-oo-ooo!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>This weird sound, supposed to be very much
like the mournful howl of the timber wolf
heard on a wintry night in the wilderness,
caused the boy on the bicycle to laugh softly
to himself as he looked up.</p>
<p>After running an errand for his mother to
one of the farmers&rsquo; wives, he had been pedaling
carelessly along up the dusty road.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<p>A couple of fellows of about his own age, one
of whom was inclined to be rather stout, were
coming along a side road, making frantic motions
for him to wait until they arrived; the
boy chuckled again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems like Billy is getting that signal cry
of the Wolf Patrol down pretty pat,&rdquo; he told
himself, as he dropped off his wheel at the
junction of the two roads to await the arrival
of his friends, both of whom wore the well-known
khaki uniforms of the scouts, just as the
lone rider did.</p>
<p>A minute later and they, too, dismounted,
one gracefully, and the other with the awkwardness
that usually accompanies the heavy-weight
boy. Both of them were apparently
pleased at having run across their comrade at
just that particular time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello! Hugh!&rdquo; called out the stout boy, &ldquo;we
stopped in at your house, and they told us you&rsquo;d
gone out to Farmer Benton&rsquo;s on an errand for
your mother. So Arthur said we might run
across you heading for home, which we sure
have done.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, Chief,&rdquo; added the more slender
lad who had been called Arthur. &ldquo;We
want you to come along with us and pass judgment
on my contraption of a wireless outfit
that I&rsquo;ve rigged out up on Cedar Hill. I finished
the work yesterday morning, and meant
to get some of you fellows up there in the afternoon,
but things kept on happening over at
our house one after the other, till it was too
late to bother. You&rsquo;ll go along, I hope, Chief?&rdquo;</p>
<p>These three lads were all members of the
well-known Wolf Patrol of the local troop of
Boy Scouts. They had been chiefly instrumental
in starting the popular movement in town;
and had passed through many rather remarkable
scenes in common, most of which have
been described at length in previous stories of
the Series.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<p>Hugh Hardin had early been made the patrol
leader, and when the assistant scout master of
the troop had lately been compelled to resign,
Hugh, as the most popular fellow among the
scouts, had been elected to take his place. It is
necessary that the boy who would take upon
himself the responsibility of being an assistant
scout master should above all be a first-class
scout; secondly, he must be elected to the office
by his mates; and last of all be recommended
by the chief scout officers of that district. Only
when these conditions have been met will the
coveted certificate be sent out from Boy Scout
Headquarters in New York City.</p>
<p>Hugh had received approval some weeks before,
and a few of the boys had come to calling
him &ldquo;Chief&rdquo; when off by themselves for a good
time. Of course, when the regular scout master,
Lieutenant Denmead, a retired United
States army officer, was along, Hugh would
expect to be treated with the same courtesy
that was extended to that gentleman, and insist
upon the usual scout salute at meeting.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<p>Billy Worth had always been a great admirer
and chum of Hugh. He believed the
other to be the best all-round boy in that whole
country. Consequently he had seemed more
concerned than Hugh himself when Alec
Sands, the son of the rich railroad magnate,
and in many ways a spoiled boy, had on various
occasions tried to get the better of Hugh. Alec
was the leader of the wideawake Otter Patrol,
a clever scout, and with a small following of
his own; but he was none too popular among
the members of the Fox and Hawk patrols.
This had accounted for his failure to be elected
to the office of assistant scout master at the
time he and Hugh locked horns while running
for the position.</p>
<p>Arthur Cameron had been the last one to
join the Wolf Patrol, completing its roster of
eight members, and for some time he had been
called the &ldquo;tenderfoot.&rdquo; Hugh, however, managed
to arouse his interest in the wonderful
secrets of Nature a scout who keeps his eyes
and ears wide open may learn, especially when
in the woods. From that day on Arthur had
striven to perfect himself in the knowledge of
those things which a boy must know in order
to climb the ladder of scout preferment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p>Arthur had after a while become a second-class
scout, and only at the last meeting of the
troop he had been listed in the proud rank of
those who were entitled to wear the full official
badge, denoting that they were in the first division.
The Wolf Patrol now had no tenderfoot
and only three second-class scouts. Hugh
hoped that in due time even these laggards
would arouse themselves and show ambition to
pluck the fruit from the tree of knowledge that
was within such easy reach.</p>
<p>When Arthur made his appeal, Hugh looked
a little thoughtful; the other boys at the same
time showed signs of more or less eagerness.
Hugh&rsquo;s opinion was worth considerable to
Arthur. While perhaps the patrol leader did
not know half as much about the intricate details
connected with a wireless outfit as Arthur
himself, at the same time he could always grasp
things in a broad way, and make valuable suggestions
that others might profit by.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t see any reason why I shouldn&rsquo;t
turn around and take a little spin up there with
you boys,&rdquo; Hugh announced, presently. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
done the errand for my mother, and have one
of Mrs. Benton&rsquo;s good yeast cakes in my
pocket. She wants my mother to try a loaf of
her morning&rsquo;s baking. It&rsquo;s tied to the handle
bars of my wheel. But there&rsquo;s no need of my
hurrying back home because mother doesn&rsquo;t
mean to use the yeast till to-morrow, anyhow.
All right, Arthur, I&rsquo;ll go along. I&rsquo;m mighty
much interested in this scheme of yours. Perhaps
after all, if the wireless works, and we get
in touch with you while along the coast, you&rsquo;ll
have nearly as much fun staying home here
as the lucky scouts who accompany the Naval
Reserve on their maneuvering cruise aboard
the scout cruiser, <i>Vixen</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>&ldquo;Glad to hear you say so, Hugh,&rdquo; said the
other, flushing with pleasure. &ldquo;I was away
down in the dumps when I found that I hadn&rsquo;t
a look-in on that trip. It was Billy here who
asked why I didn&rsquo;t finish that wireless I&rsquo;d
started up on the top of Cedar Hill. He said
what was the harm in my trying to pick up
messages you fellows would send out from
time to time while aboard the scout cruiser,
practicing all sorts of things, just as though
there was a regular war on between the United
States and some foreign power, Japan for instance.
And now she&rsquo;s ready for business.
Let&rsquo;s be off. If you say my outfit works fairly
decent I&rsquo;ll be feeling fifty per cent. better. It&rsquo;s
awful to see my chums going away on such
a picnic, while I have to stay home.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>&ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; grunted Billy, as he threw a plump
leg over his saddle and prepared to begin
pedaling, &ldquo;what about poor me? I came in
<i>third</i> on the list when only two in a patrol could
go. Just missed being a favored son by a
hair&rsquo;s breadth. I nearly swooned when I saw
what a narrow escape I&rsquo;d had from getting to
go on the dandiest trip that ever came down
the pike. I&rsquo;m getting as thin as a rail peeving
about my hard luck. By the time you fellows
come back, Hugh, I&rsquo;ll be fit to enter a freak
museum under the name of a Living Skeleton.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like fun you will,&rdquo; jeered Arthur, who
knew Billy like a book. &ldquo;I notice that you&rsquo;re
just as fond of eating and sleeping as ever.
No fellow who can do the stunts along those
lines that you&rsquo;re capable of is going to lose
flesh. Don&rsquo;t ever worry about Billy, Hugh.
He may feel bad about not going, but all the
same, mark my words, he&rsquo;ll have a good time
at home. He always carries the sunshine with
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And indeed that was about the truth, for
Billy could joke and make merry when many
of his mates were pulling long faces over the
troubles that pressed thick and fast upon the
patrol. It was his nature to be happy and
jolly; he could not help radiating sunshine all
the time.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>They sped along the road, gradually getting
to where the woods came down on either side,
and elevations could be seen close by. The
particular place which the amateur wireless
operator had chosen as the site for his exploits
in constructing his masts and aerials
was known as Cedar Hill. It chanced to be a
bit of the extensive property which the Camerons
owned up in this region; which possibly
was one reason Arthur had chosen it. He
could lop off branches from such trees as he
wanted to use without danger of being taken
to task by some irate farmer, who might seriously
object to destruction of valuable cedars.</p>
<p>There was quite a dense woods leading up
to the crown of the hill and the boys would
of course have to abandon their wheels down
by the road.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>&ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;d better take this precious home-made
loaf of bread along with me,&rdquo; Hugh
said as they thrust their bicycles in among
the bushes near by. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s got such a fine smell
of baking about it that some wandering hog
might find it out. Wouldn&rsquo;t I be mad clear
through to get back here and find it gone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, that does go right to the spot,&rdquo; remarked
Billy as he leaned over to sniff at the
paper-covered package. &ldquo;If we should happen
to get lost now, like the babes in the wood,
why that same bully loaf&rsquo;d keep us from starving
to death. Any danger of your losing the
trail, Arthur?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve been up here so often that I&rsquo;ve
marked it pretty well,&rdquo; replied the other laughingly.
&ldquo;Suppose you lead the way, Billy, while
I talk with the Chief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure I will,&rdquo; Billy sang out cheerfully. &ldquo;Always
willing to be a victim. Anything to oblige,
boys. &lsquo;Walk this way,&rsquo; please, as the bow-legged
salesman said to the haughty lady, before
he started to show her through the store. What
impertinence! I should say you had worn a
plain trail, Arthur. A greenhorn could follow
it in and out, past logs, and around holes. You
had your Injun woodcraft down fine when you
laid this out.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>Unconsciously the two who were engaged in
some serious conversation, lagged more or less,
though perhaps it was Billy, anxious to reach
the crown of Cedar Hill, who displayed an unwonted
animation in ascending the rather steep
rise, and see what the final result of the other
scout&rsquo;s labors had been.</p>
<p>Once or twice Hugh&mdash;glancing up&mdash;saw that
Billy had passed from sight, though he could
still be heard clambering through the brush
beyond. Occasionally some exclamation told
that he might have clumsily stumbled over a
root or a clinging vine. They were all of two-thirds
of the way up when there came a sudden
shriek from Billy that made the other
boys stop short and look startled. Billy, however,
was so prone to play practical jokes that
no one knew how to take him. He could be
plainly heard tearing headlong down the face
of the wooded hill, and in a few seconds came
panting back, his usually florid face white
with sudden fear.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>&ldquo;What ails you, Billy?&rdquo; demanded Hugh,
puzzled to account for his actions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seen a garter snake, did you, Billy?&rdquo;
jeered Arthur. &ldquo;Oh! plenty of that kind
around here, but they can&rsquo;t hurt you. Thought
it was a rattler, now, I bet you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a b-e-a-r&mdash;a great big black bear &rsquo;bout
ten feet tall, and standin&rsquo; on his hind legs
awaitin&rsquo; to hug a feller to death!&rdquo; came from
the white lips of the scout who had led the van
of the trail followers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<h2 id="c2">CHAPTER II.
<br /><span class="small">SCOUT TACTICS.</span></h2>
<p>Hugh had known Billy Worth to be addicted
to playing practical jokes on many occasions,
but he was really puzzled to guess the truth
when the other so loudly declared he had met
with a bear on the trail above.</p>
<p>There were a number of small wild animals
still to be found in that section of the country.
Hugh himself had met with a ferocious wildcat
on one of the camping trips of the troop
up at Pioneer Lake, but such a thing as a black
bear had not been seen by any one for many
years.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>Billy was certainly not playing a part, Hugh
quickly decided. The patrol leader had thrown
out an arm, so as to block the passage and
prevent Billy from continuing his mad flight,
for he gave evidences of being inclined that
way. He kept looking back along the hill trail
as though fully anticipating seeing a huge
hairy monster suddenly loom up. He stood
ready to break away and once more dash down
toward the road to the place where the bicycles
had been left.</p>
<p>Arthur, though not free from a touch of
panic himself, began to suspect that it was all
a humbug. He turned on Billy and scornfully
demanded:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Show us your old bear, can&rsquo;t you? March
him up and let&rsquo;s look him in the eye! I reckon
that you&rsquo;re trying to rattle your boon companions,
that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re up to, Billy Worth.
It don&rsquo;t go, and you might as well call it off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Billy began to get a grip on himself, for
there is nothing like derision to bring a boy to
his proper senses. He straightened up, and a
tinge of color came back into his plump cheeks
as he retorted:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t believe me&mdash;let&rsquo;s see you go
right along up there, that&rsquo;s all! Let me tell
you this, Arthur Cameron, if you&rsquo;ll agree to
walk straight along this same trail right up to
your old wireless fixing on top of Cedar Hill,
I&rsquo;ll&mdash;yes, I&rsquo;ll agree to <i>give</i> you that hunting
knife of mine you asked me to trade for your
spare compass. Get that, do you? And I&rsquo;m
safe in making the offer, too, because I know
you&rsquo;ll get the rattles as bad as I did just as
soon as you set eyes on that terrible monster!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hugh was still studying the other. He wondered
what it could have been that Billy had
really seen to alarm him so much. As a rule
the other scout was not given to wild imaginings
like several other boys connected
with the troop whom Hugh knew very well.
On the contrary Billy had generally shown
a steadiness much to his credit; he was matter-of-fact
and not often given to romancing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This thing has gone far enough, Billy,&rdquo; he
said sternly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>&ldquo;I know you don&rsquo;t believe what I say, Chief,&rdquo;
complained the other, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m going to raise
my hand, and on the honor of a scout say once
more that I did really and truly see a bear!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, let it go at that,&rdquo; said Hugh. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
believe that you thought you saw some sort
of thing that <i>looked like a bear</i>. I&rsquo;ve known
fellows who saw ghosts and believed it as
much as they could anything, till it was proven
that the moving white object was a pillow-slip
left out on the clothes line, floating up and
down in the soft night air. Sometimes in the
dim woods a stump can look mighty like a big
black bear, I&rsquo;m told.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;P&rsquo;raps that&rsquo;s all true enough, Hugh,&rdquo; persisted
the other, &ldquo;but when you see it rear up
on its hind legs, and start at you&mdash;that looks
different, don&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; demanded the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! then it moved, did it? actually got up
on its hind legs and wanted to give you the
high sign?&rdquo; jeered Arthur still unconvinced.
&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s what you get for belonging to
the Wolf Patrol. This wonderful bear thought
you might be his own cousin. He meant to
shake hands with you, Billy.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>Billy shrugged his broad shoulders. Though
still looking a little anxious, he was no longer
white in the face. This scepticism on the part
of Arthur had the good effect of arousing
what was combative in his jolly nature, and
putting fresh courage in his boyish heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he went on to say resolutely, &ldquo;I can
see that you&rsquo;ll never be satisfied till you meet
up with that bear for yourself, Arthur. So
s&rsquo;pose you hike out. We&rsquo;ll follow after you.
I dare you to, get that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>No boy can easily stand being put on his
mettle. With quaking heart many a lad has
started into a country churchyard on a dark
night or in some other such reckless venture
just because his mates have given him the
&ldquo;dare.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>Arthur gave a quick look up the trail. So
far as he could see, there did not appear to be
anything amiss in that direction. Surely if a
hungry bear did lurk near by he would have
been apt to show himself ere this.</p>
<p>So Arthur, feeling that he had gone too far
now to show the white feather, threw out his
chest, and stepped ahead of the other two.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, you watch me show you up for
the biggest fakir going, Billy,&rdquo; he remarked
with all the firmness he could command. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
passed up and down along the same trail dozens
of times, and if there&rsquo;d been such a thing
as a bear around&mdash;well, wouldn&rsquo;t I be apt to
know it? Guess I would. Now, I&rsquo;ve seen a
fox once, a little red fox; likewise a skunk
that I gave a wide berth to. There was a rabbit
that used to jump out of the bushes every
single day, sometimes giving me a start, if I
happened to be thinking hard and forgot about
it. Wonder whether anybody could make out
one of those to be a bear!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! go on and climb, that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; chuckled
the confident Billy. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see if I&rsquo;ve got
magnifiers in my eyes this time.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>&ldquo;And what if we don&rsquo;t see your bear?&rdquo; asked
Arthur. He started rather slowly to mount
the trail, keeping a bright lookout ahead, which
caution rather belied his confident way of expressing
his disbelief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will, all right,&rdquo; replied the other from
behind Hugh. &ldquo;Even if he&rsquo;s dusted out, can&rsquo;t
we look for his tracks? What&rsquo;s the use of
being scouts if we aren&rsquo;t able to tell what the
marks of a bear&rsquo;s paw and claws look like?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arthur did not reply in words. He did cast
a quick glance over his shoulder, however,
which may have been simply to make sure his
chums were close at his heels, though Hugh
rather suspected the leader to be desirous of
making certain that there was a clear field for
flight open to him in case of necessity. Caution
as well as valor is a part of a scout&rsquo;s education,
and he who is wise will always know
of a way for retreat though scorning to make
use of the same.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>Billy in the rear was evidently very much in
earnest. Hugh could hear him breathing
hard, as if his excitement were returning in
full force the closer they drew to the place
where he had met his recent alarming adventure.</p>
<p>Although he could not believe it possible that
Billy had actually seen such a thing as a bear,
still Hugh confessed to feeling considerable
curiosity himself in the matter. He had already
made up his mind that it would turn out
to be some old stump that stood in a rather
dark and gloomy spot. Perhaps a squirrel had
run up the stump, frightened by the sudden
appearance of the boy, and this movement,
coupled with the queer appearance of the remnant
of a tree, had given Billy his scare.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>Well, they would soon know what it might
have been. Arthur was steadily advancing up
the hillside, none too swiftly it must be confessed.
He had apparently remembered all
he had ever learned about the habits of a real
scout when passing through lonely woods
where dangers were apt to lurk, for it could be
seen that he was turning his head to the right
and to the left from time to time, as if determined
that nothing should escape his observation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen! didn&rsquo;t you hear something that
sounded like a whine?&rdquo; asked Billy from his
position of safety in the rear.</p>
<p>It might have been just like him to try and
add to the nervousness of the scout who led
the van, but Hugh knew that this was not so;
he too had caught some sort of odd sound at
the same time that the other spoke so thrillingly.
As for Arthur, he stopped short.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What could that have been, Hugh?&rdquo; he
asked anxiously, while the satisfied Billy actually
began to chuckle with glee at seeing the
doubting one begin to show signs of wavering.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t say, Arthur,&rdquo; replied the scout
master promptly. &ldquo;Some sort of animal made
it. I should think even a fox could bark loud
enough for that, or a weasel snarl because he
was bothered while feeding. Want me to lead
off, Arthur?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Perhaps the boy would have been glad of
the chance to say yes, but knowing how Billy
would exult at his sudden change of heart he
shut his teeth hard together and merely replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I should say not, Hugh. I don&rsquo;t
make out to be the bravest scout in the troop
in the Wolf Patrol, but I hope I am not ready
to lie down and crawl just because I happen
to hear a silly old whine. Chances are it&rsquo;s
some dog that&rsquo;s been digging out a rabbit burrow
up here and wants to let us know he&rsquo;s on
deck. Come on, both of you, and let&rsquo;s see
what&rsquo;s up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that Arthur resumed his upward progress,
covering foot after foot, continuing his
careful survey ahead. Hugh was really proud
of the way the late &ldquo;tenderfoot&rdquo; managed to
carry on the lead so successfully; even under
the exciting conditions the scout master could
pay attention to such things, since they concerned
his duties as instructor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>&ldquo;Just a little further, Arthur, and you&rsquo;ll
turn that sharp bend,&rdquo; almost whispered Billy,
pressing up against Hugh in his intense eagerness
to see what would happen. &ldquo;Oh! there
was that whine again, Hugh! Mebbe you&rsquo;ll
believe me after a bit. Mebbe you&rsquo;ll give me
credit for havin&rsquo; eyes in my head! Steady
now, old wireless! A few more steps, and
you&rsquo;re bound to strike something or I&rsquo;ll eat
my hat!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This sort of talk was well calculated to increase
the manifest nervousness of Arthur,
but he was at least game to the backbone, not
dreaming of showing the white feather, the
thing above all others that any ordinary boy
dreads to do.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>Hugh pressed a little closer to the leader.
He wanted to be on hand for what was going
to happen, no matter whether this turned out
to be along tragic or comical lines. And besides,
Arthur was visibly trembling, as though
he needed some strong arm to back him up.
If he felt Hugh touching his elbow it would
doubtless afford him more or less comfort.</p>
<p>Then Arthur, with set jaws, summoning
all his resolution to the fore, made the last
step needed to take him around that bend in
the trail where the tall bushes seemed to shut
out what lay beyond.</p>
<p>No sooner had he done so than he seemed
to be changed into stone, for he stood there
like a statue carved out of marble, staring at
something that lay just beyond. Billy came
pushing up just in time to hear the pilot of the
expedition gasp:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look! look, Hugh! Is that really a bear,
or am I seeing things I shouldn&rsquo;t?&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the scout master had taken a second
look he made a discovery that seemed to afford
him more or less satisfaction, for he immediately
called out:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a live bear, all right, Arthur. Billy
wasn&rsquo;t dreaming, it seems. Look closer and
you&rsquo;ll find that the poor thing is tied to that
tree with a rope; and chances are it&rsquo;s the performing
bear I heard was over at Salem last
week!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that both of the other boys breathed
freely once more. Billy puffed out his chest,
filled with pride because his astonishing declaration
had at least been proven true.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<h2 id="c3">CHAPTER III.
<br /><span class="small">THE DANCING BEAR.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;But it is a bear all right, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; Billy
was saying with evident satisfaction, &ldquo;and
you&rsquo;ll have to take back all you said about
my being so scared &rsquo;cause I saw a whole lot
of things that never could happen, Arthur.
Mebbe there aren&rsquo;t any wild bears a-roamin&rsquo;
around these parts any more, but I did see a
hairy monster, didn&rsquo;t I? And when I told you
he reared up on his hind legs and made like
he wanted to dance with me, I wasn&rsquo;t yarning,
you see. Huh! next time you won&rsquo;t be so ready
to make out I&rsquo;m a fakir. Magnifying a stump
into a live beast! Whew! look at him stretching
right now, will you? What are you meaning
to do, Hugh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The patrol leader had started toward the
imprisoned bear, causing Billy to ask this last
question.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I wonder where his master can be?&rdquo;
Hugh Hardin readily observed, his curiosity
aroused afresh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! taking a good long sleep somewhere in
the bushes around most likely,&rdquo; Billy remarked
unconcernedly. &ldquo;You know the breed all right,
fellows. They&rsquo;re as cruel a bunch as you&rsquo;d
find anywhere. I reckon this poor thing&rsquo;s got
heaps and heaps of big welts under his hair
from being whipped when he wouldn&rsquo;t feel
like dancing, his pole held in his forepaws.
I&rsquo;ve watched &rsquo;em do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All of them now approached the bear more
closely. The animal did not seem to be of the
common black American variety, but had a
sort of cinnamon hue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think they bring them over from Russia,
down along some part of the Caucasus or Ural
Mountains,&rdquo; Hugh was saying as the shaggy
beast, still standing erect on its haunches,
started to make those queer whining sounds
again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>&ldquo;What d&rsquo;ye reckon the old thing means by
that, Hugh?&rdquo; asked Arthur.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And look at the way he keeps working his
mouth, will you?&rdquo; added Billy. &ldquo;Tell you
what, I think he must be hungry! He smells
that fine loaf of bread you&rsquo;ve got under your
arm, Chief. Better give it to the poor beggar.
Look at him putting out his tongue, and
slathering his lips. He&rsquo;s sure begging for
something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I know what he wants most of all,&rdquo;
said Hugh. &ldquo;You can see from the way the
ground&rsquo;s torn up around that he must have
been tied here all night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whew! that would be tough on the poor
thing, wouldn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; declared Billy, who had a
tender heart and could not bear to see any
beast or bird suffer when it lay in his power
to change things for the better.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He wants a drink of water the worst kind,
boys,&rdquo; continued the patrol leader.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>&ldquo;And I know of a fine little spring not five
minutes&rsquo; walk away from here, too. I&rsquo;ve often
stepped over there when working at my wireless
to get a cold drink,&rdquo; Arthur hastened to
remark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re elected then unanimously, seeing
that you&rsquo;re the only one that knows where the
water tank lies,&rdquo; Billy told him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elected to what?&rdquo; demanded the other
scout.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why to lead the poor old bear to his drink,&rdquo;
Billy went on to say, without betraying the
least sign of humor in his round face. &ldquo;Step
right up and unfasten that greasy rope, Arthur,
while I stand by this tree ready to climb,
if so be he breaks away and comes my way.
He keeps on looking at me like he thought I
was good enough to eat. That&rsquo;s the trouble
with being nice and plump. But what ails you,
Chum Arthur? I don&rsquo;t see you jumping forward
to pat our hairy brother and tell him his
troubles are all over, since you&rsquo;ve come along.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hugh! what are we going to do about it?&rdquo;
Arthur asked, turning from his tormentor
toward the scout master.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you lead the way, I&rsquo;ll go along with you
to that spring,&rdquo; replied the other quietly. &ldquo;We
might fill our hats and perhaps that&rsquo;ll be
enough. I never saw a bear drink water, but
in hot summer weather I should think they&rsquo;d
want it as well as any other animal. Come
along, Arthur.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Billy seemed in doubt whether to offer to
accompany his comrades or remain there. He
did not altogether like the idea of finding himself
left alone with the bear. The rope looked
thin and worn, and might break. So as soon
as the others had departed, and he could hear
their voices growing fainter as they hurried
on toward Arthur&rsquo;s pet spring, Billy proceeded
to climb the tree against which he had been
leaning.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>&ldquo;Gives a fellow a better outlook, for one
thing,&rdquo; he told himself, as he straddled the
lower limb, &ldquo;and then in case the sly old rascal
did break loose, why I&rsquo;d have a halfway chance
to kick at him, and keep him down below till
they came back and Hugh tied him up again.
Scouts should be cautious as well as brave;
that&rsquo;s always been my motto. There, Hugh
went and left that loaf of bread when he took
Arthur with him to get the water. See that
bear sniffing as hard as anything, would you?
One thing sure, if he did break loose he&rsquo;d start
in to gobble that bread, and let me alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Listening he could hear the other two talking
some little distance away. It was from
this that Billy judged they had arrived at the
spring, and were proceeding to fill their campaign
hats. Although this idea of Hugh&rsquo;s
might seem a little strange on the face of it,
there was really nothing uncommon about his
desire to relieve the sufferings of the thirsty
animal. Scouts are taught to do just these
helpful things whenever the opportunity comes
along; and many a fellow has found a chance
to turn his reversed medal over for the day
by an act of mercy toward dumb beasts,&mdash;horses,
cows, or even dogs in pain or trouble
of any sort.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>Given time, Billy might have thought to the
same end himself, but his brain did not work
as rapidly as that of some of the other boys,
and as a rule he made slow progress.</p>
<p>He sat there, keeping a wary eye on the performing
bear and guessing at the progress of
his chums by catching the sound of their voices
coming louder and louder with every half minute.</p>
<p>Then Billy breathed more freely when he
saw their figures flitting carefully among the
trees near by, so as not to spill more of the
water than could be helped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good for you, boys!&rdquo; he called out as he
hastened to slip down from his elevated perch,
but not soon enough to escape the sharp eyes
of Arthur, who immediately took him to task
for deserting the solid earth.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wise old Billy, ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; he remarked, jeeringly.
&ldquo;He wasn&rsquo;t going to take any chances
of being nibbled at by the tame bear, was he?
Climbed a tree, didn&rsquo;t you, son? Just as if
bears couldn&rsquo;t shin up a trunk like hot cakes!
You&rsquo;re a bright one, I must say, Billy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right and I am not ashamed to
admit it, either,&rdquo; asserted the other stoutly.
&ldquo;A scout should never be rash, the rules say.
Why should I take unnecessary chances, when
I knew that bear had his eye on me, and
thought I&rsquo;d make a good lunch? If he&rsquo;d been
tackling you, Arthur, I&rsquo;d show you what I&rsquo;d
do if I had to grab him from the back, and
wrestle with him like his master does; only he
hasn&rsquo;t his muzzle on right now, and that&rsquo;d be
bad. Does he drink, Hugh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>While the others were indulging in this little
exchange of sentiments, the scout master had
advanced toward the tied bear holding out his
hat water-pail. The animal eagerly thrust his
snout into the cool liquid and seemed to be
drinking after a fashion, which told that Hugh
had been right when he said the beast must
have been fastened here for some time.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>&ldquo;He wasn&rsquo;t there when I came down from
the top of the hill yesterday morning, I give
you my word for that, Chief,&rdquo; Arthur announced,
as he stood ready to hand his hat of
water over to the other, should the first supply
prove insufficient to satisfy the poor beast.
&ldquo;You can see for yourself that it would be
impossible for me to have passed on this trail
and missed running across him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what d&rsquo;ye reckon has become of
his master, and how are we goin&rsquo; to get the
dancing bear back to town, when he don&rsquo;t know
us? That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;d like to know,&rdquo; Billy demanded
apprehensively, not as yet daring to
come within five feet of the sleek monster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m bothered to know what it all means,&rdquo;
Hugh told them. &ldquo;When he fastened the bear
here, the man must have had some notion in
his head but he&rsquo;s been kept from coming back
again.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>&ldquo;Would he want to abandon the poor thing
just because it wasn&rsquo;t paying him to tote the
bear along?&rdquo; asked Arthur.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t think that could be,&rdquo; said Hugh.
&ldquo;As far as I know, these men who own trained
bears always make a good deal of money and
they spend mighty little. Besides, such an animal
would be worth fifty or a hundred dollars
for exhibition purposes, I&rsquo;d think. No, there&rsquo;s
some other reason for it. I&rsquo;ve got half a notion
to try to find the man&rsquo;s track leading away
from here, and see which way he did go. What
if he fell down some little precipice&mdash;there are
such things around these hills&mdash;and broke his
leg? Why, he might lie there and die for all
anybody&rsquo;d hear him call, up in this lonely
region.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>Both of the other scouts were more or less
worked up by what the patrol leader had just
said. It was not very difficult for them to picture
a variety of serious perils along the lines
suggested by Hugh; they rather liked the
idea of picking up the departing trail of the
foreigner just to see if they would be equal
to the task of discovering him, perhaps asleep,
near by.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t see how anybody could sleep
through all that noise Billy here put up,&rdquo; Arthur
chose to remark, &ldquo;when he came rushing
down the hill with his hair standing on end,
and his eyes looking as if they would drop out
of his head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! hold on, there, go easy with a fellow,
can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; urged Billy reproachfully. &ldquo;Of
course I own up I was some scared, but it
wasn&rsquo;t as bad as all that, and you know it,
Arthur. Guess anybody&rsquo;d have had some
shock to run across that thing all of a sudden
and believe it to be a wild bear.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, before we&rsquo;re done with it,&rdquo; boasted
Arthur, &ldquo;you may see me riding on the old
fellow&rsquo;s broad back like as not. They&rsquo;re really
as tame and docile as kittens, I was told; that
is, after they get to know you, and you&rsquo;ve fed
&rsquo;em a few times so they&rsquo;ll look on you as a
friend. There, he acts as though he&rsquo;d had all
the water he wanted, Hugh. Just throw out
the rest, and I&rsquo;ll put on my wet hat, which
ought to feel nice and cool after all that soaking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hugh was already commencing to cast
around in search of tracks that would be of a
far different type from their own,&mdash;prints
made by broad-soled hob-nailed shoes, such as
these Russian immigrants wear. This made
it look as though he had been quite in earnest
when he made that assertion about feeling in
the humor to try and follow the trail the bear&rsquo;s
master had left when he departed on his unknown
errand.</p>
<p>Billy happened to think of that loaf of bread
which the patrol leader had laid down when
arriving on the scene. Some spirit of mischief
caused the boy to step over, and picking
the package up advance toward the tied bear,
holding it out to see what the animal would do.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>He found out, and in a big hurry too, after
a fashion he had evidently not suspected would
come to pass. The animal sniffed harder than
ever as he caught the tantalizing odor of the
freshly baked bread. If it had held a good
scent for the boy who had stuffed himself at
breakfast only an hour or two ago, fancy how
it excited the bear, which must have been very
hungry indeed.</p>
<p>Before Billy could realize how all those
frantic pullings might result, he heard the
worn rope give a sudden sharp snap where it
had gone around the tree. Then he saw that
the eager bear was now loose, and advancing
quickly toward him, growling and whining
with eagerness, and impatient to break his long
fast!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<h2 id="c4">CHAPTER IV.
<br /><span class="small">THE TRACKING GAME.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Hugh, oh! Hugh! he&rsquo;s loose!&rdquo;</p>
<p>These boys of the Wolf Patrol had become
so accustomed to depending on their energetic
leader when trouble threatened that this cry
pealed from the lips of Billy Worth as naturally
as he would eat his supper, given half a
chance.</p>
<p>The sight of that bear standing on his two
hind legs and advancing eagerly toward him
gave Billy the shock of his life. He realized
that being without any kind of weapon, he was
powerless to resist should the hungry animal
seize hold of him, and commence breaking his
fast. Billy did not know, or at least failed to
remember then under such tremendous excitement,
that bears, at least of this species, are
more addicted to a diet of roots, berries, and
cereals when they can get them, than flesh.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>He dropped the loaf of bread, though the
act was more the result of his fright than any
idea of coaxing the beast to turn his attention
elsewhere, and let him, Billy, alone.</p>
<p>Arthur was close by, but as incapable of
assisting his chum as Billy was of helping himself;
it seemed as though Arthur must have
been paralyzed by the sight of that tall monster
pushing directly at the other scout. Arthur remained
standing there with open mouth and
staring eyes, never so much as lifting a hand.</p>
<p>When the bear began to sniff eagerly, and
then dropped suddenly on all fours, as though
meaning to hunt for the loaf which had fallen,
Billy experienced a feeling of intense relief.</p>
<p>He was actually able to get some momentum,
for up to then, while desirous of beating a retreat
he had seemed frozen to the ground; he
could remember passing through a similar experience
when suffering from a species of
nightmare.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>So Billy fell back several paces, all the while
observing the actions of the educated bear as
though fascinated.</p>
<p>It would seem that the animal must have
been given a loaf of bread tied up in paper
many times in the past. Perhaps that was his
customary daily allowance. He started to tear
the covering away, undoubtedly fully aware
of the necessity for doing this before he could
get at the contents. And Billy thought he
showed almost human intelligence about it,
too; in fact, he afterward declared his positive
belief that Bruin had deliberately untied
the string with his teeth and claws.</p>
<p>At any rate, whether that was true or only
imagination on the part of the staring boy,
the bear was munching eagerly at the bread
by the time Hugh arrived on the spot, which
proved how quickly all this had been accomplished.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s happening, Billy?&rdquo; asked the patrol
leader, though of course he could see that the
bear was busily engaged with something just
then.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s hooked your lovely bread, that&rsquo;s what,
Hugh!&rdquo; gasped the other, pointing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! well, let it go at that,&rdquo; replied Hugh,
with a short laugh. &ldquo;Seems like a pity to waste
Mrs. Benton&rsquo;s prime bread on such a beast;
but since he&rsquo;s nearly starved, and has got his
teeth in the loaf, there&rsquo;s no stopping him now.
But how did it happen <i>you</i> had the bread in
your hands, Billy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was all my fault, I guess, Hugh,&rdquo; answered
the now contrite Billy. &ldquo;I just thought
I&rsquo;d see how he acted when he got a whiff of
that new bread, and would you believe me, he
just leaned so hard on his rope that it snapped
where it was fastened around the tree. Whoo!
if I hadn&rsquo;t had the good sense to drop the
bread I reckon he&rsquo;d have bitten a hunk out of
my leg!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he&rsquo;s free now, Hugh,&rdquo; spoke up Arthur.
&ldquo;What can we do about it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>&ldquo;While he&rsquo;s so busy with the bread I&rsquo;ll try
and see if I can get hold of that rope and fix
him again,&rdquo; remarked the patrol leader, not
believing it would prove a very difficult task.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be careful, Hugh. He&rsquo;s got wicked-looking
teeth! I can see &rsquo;em!&rdquo; Billy warned his
chum anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And his claws haven&rsquo;t been trimmed this
long while, seems like,&rdquo; added Arthur.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll look out, make your minds easy on that
question,&rdquo; Hugh told them. &ldquo;Both of you
stand where you are, and keep moving your
arms so as to sort of hold his attention. I
think I can see how the job is going to be done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A good idea, sure it is!&rdquo; Billy declared and
immediately began to swing both of his arms
as though they were parts of some windmill
with a twenty-mile-an-hour gale blowing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Easy now, not quite so hard, Billy!&rdquo; Hugh
admonished as he started to pass to the rear
of the munching brute, where he had discovered
the broken end of the rope lying on the
ground.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>The others continued to move their arms and
talk as they watched Hugh work. In the first
place he bent down and secured the rope. He
found that by advancing closer to the bear he
would be able to pass it around a stout little
sapling and knot the end securely. What if
the munching beast did growl more or less as
he became conscious of Hugh&rsquo;s presence. That
was just the way any dog would do when disturbed
while crunching a bone between his
teeth; and the scout master did not mean to let
it deter him from the task he had set out to
perform.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All done, Hugh?&rdquo; burst out the admiring
Billy when he saw the other starting to move
back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and if the rope only holds this time
he&rsquo;ll stay there till his master shows up to take
him in charge,&rdquo; came from the other.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p>&ldquo;You did it in first-class style, and that&rsquo;s a
fact, Chief!&rdquo; asserted the relieved Arthur.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, what&rsquo;s next on the program?&rdquo; demanded
Billy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, as I&rsquo;ve managed to find the tracks of
the foreigner leaving here, I thought we might
start out and follow the trail,&rdquo; suggested the
patrol leader.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine!&rdquo; ejaculated Billy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I think the same,&rdquo; added Arthur,
&ldquo;though I hope that after we&rsquo;re all through
with this job you&rsquo;ll still come back with me,
and try out my wireless, Hugh. Promise me
that, won&rsquo;t you, please?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>&ldquo;You can count on me, Arthur,&rdquo; the other
assured him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m almost as much interested
in your experiment as you can be yourself. I
think it would be a great thing if we could
talk across all the distance between while you&rsquo;re
home here and some of the scouts are on board
the <i>Vixen</i> bound up the coast. It would show
the boys of the Naval Reserve that scouts are
not so <i>slow</i> after all to keep up with the procession.
Yes, you can count on me, Arthur, to
watch you work your wireless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Hugh. Let&rsquo;s see if we can find
out what&rsquo;s become of the man who owns this
poor bear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hugh immediately led his chums over where
he had been working at the moment that
the tocsin of alarm from Billy announced that
something unusual had happened, and that he
was needed in another quarter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See here and here,&rdquo; Hugh told them, pointing
as he spoke to the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is his trail as sure as anything,&rdquo; admitted
Billy instantly. &ldquo;And he&rsquo;s wearing
shoes with great big hob-nails in them, too.
Most of these foreigners do that, I guess.
They make their shoes wear twice as long;
and every cent saved means they can go back
all the sooner to their old home with a little
fortune tucked away in their corduroys or
jeans. Lead off, Hugh, and we&rsquo;ll be right at
your heels. And show us anything queer you
happen to run across on the trail, see?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>&ldquo;Because as scouts,&rdquo; added Arthur, promptly,
&ldquo;we want to be up to all the wrinkles of the
business, you know. I find out new things
every day, and it seems like the more you know
the more you discover you don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a queer way of saying it, Arthur,&rdquo;
laughed Hugh, &ldquo;but it covers the ground, I
think. You mean the field keeps on getting
larger the more our horizon is extended, which
is what one writer says. Come on then, we&rsquo;ll
leave the bear to finish his bread, and lick up
the crumbs. I had thought to have a share
of that brown loaf myself, but it went in a
good cause and I don&rsquo;t feel sorry.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>With the scout master leading them and all
bending low so as to keep a close watch on the
tracks, they started forth. None of them could
tell just where that trail might take them,&mdash;a
dozen possibilities opened up before their mental
vision. If they thought anything at all,
possibly Billy and Arthur were convinced that
the foreigner may have wanted to get rid of
his charge, and had thus basely abandoned the
poor bear to its fate. Then again there was a
chance that in going to town he may have been
arrested for some trivial thing, and was even
then languishing in the lockup, unable to make
the police understand that his performing bear
would starve unless some one went up to Cedar
Hill to relieve the animal&rsquo;s wants.</p>
<p>Several times Hugh did call a temporary
halt. He had come upon some phase of the
trail that might have mystified a greenhorn,
but which proved no puzzle to him, because of
his wide experience in these things. And he
took pleasure in explaining to his comrades
what the combination meant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems that the fellow might be trying
to blind anybody that chanced to be following
his tracks,&rdquo; Hugh once told his mates. &ldquo;Three
times now he&rsquo;s even gone to the trouble to
walk along a fallen tree trunk, and jump from
the further end. If I didn&rsquo;t know the old Indian
dodge, it would have fooled me, too.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>&ldquo;And I never heard about such a game,&rdquo;
admitted Arthur, while Billy nodded his head
acknowledging the same thing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But whatever do you think he wants to do
that for, Hugh?&rdquo; the last named asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Billy,&rdquo; replied the patrol
leader thoughtfully. &ldquo;Seems to me he might
be following a series of marks somehow, for
look here at this plain &lsquo;blaze&rsquo; on this tree, made
at least several months ago, perhaps even last
year. Now, it might be possible that the man
has got a secret <i>cache</i> somewhere around,
where he keeps his valuables; and whenever
he finds himself in this neighborhood he goes
there to add to the hoard, looking to the time
when he thinks he will have enough saved to
go back home with. And he has made a secret
trail from where he left his bear to this hiding
place.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but while that sounds all to the good,
Hugh,&rdquo; protested Billy, &ldquo;why should he stay
away so long?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll hope to find that out before we&rsquo;re
done,&rdquo; Hugh told them; &ldquo;that is, fellows, if you
don&rsquo;t say you&rsquo;ve had enough of this tracking
game, and want to call it off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both the others immediately vigorously protested
that they were not dreaming of such a
thing; that they stood ready to back the scout
master up, even if they had to continue this
rambling around up and down among the
rough places of the mountain until dark set in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, that settles it,&rdquo; said Hugh. &ldquo;Let
me tell you this is just pie for me. I&rsquo;m never
so happy as when trying to find out the answer
to some knotty problem. We&rsquo;ll keep right
on, even if the zigzag trail takes us all the way
to the town lock-up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ten minutes later Hugh held up his hand
warningly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<p>&ldquo;Steady, boys!&rdquo; he remarked quietly.
&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a bad place where the bushes seem to
screen the brink of a little precipice; you can
see for yourselves that the man we&rsquo;re tracking
must have stumbled at the worst spot he could
have picked out to take the dip. Here is where
he crashed through the bushes; and look, when
I part them with my hands, you can see that
there&rsquo;s a bad drop beyond.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; said Arthur.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you think you heard?&rdquo; gasped
Billy, looking somewhat awed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sounded awfully like a groan!&rdquo; replied the
other solemnly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<h2 id="c5">CHAPTER V.
<br /><span class="small">A SCOUT AMBULANCE.</span></h2>
<p>All of them crouching there listened eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There it comes again!&rdquo; exclaimed Arthur,
excitedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it is a groan as sure as anything!&rdquo;
added Billy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, the poor fellow must have fallen over
here, and been hurt so badly that he wasn&rsquo;t able
to get up again,&rdquo; Hugh announced, and then
crawling forward to the verge of the precipice
he took an observation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See him, Hugh?&rdquo; questioned Billy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he&rsquo;s down there in a heap,&rdquo; came the
reply. &ldquo;Looks as if he might have tried again
and again to work his way up, and had to quit
through weakness. Come on, let&rsquo;s work our
way around, boys. I think there must be some
easier path down there than the one he took.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>&ldquo;Gee whiz! I should hope so!&rdquo; muttered
Billy, who had also ventured to take a peep
over the edge, though without seeing the fallen
master of the bear.</p>
<p>They skirted the precipice and as Hugh had
predicted, soon discovered that it was possible
to make the descent by means of a shelving
path, which doubtless the wretched man had
not found out. Presently they had reached the
place where he lay.</p>
<p>He was looking terribly gaunt and haggard,
more from the result of his intense pain and
anxiety than because he had been imprisoned
so long in that trap. When the trio of scouts
came upon him, the man&rsquo;s face lighted up with
new hope. He held out his hands eagerly
toward them, bursting into a torrent of words,
most of which they failed to understand because
they may have been Russian, and like so
much gibberish in their ears.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>If the poor fellow was in any doubt as to
their pacific and kindly intentions, the reassuring
smiles on the faces of the scouts must
have soon allayed his fears.</p>
<p>Hugh tried to tell him that they had found
his bear, and followed his trail all the way
along the side of old Stormberg Mountain to
this place where he had met with his accident.
He also gave the man to understand that they
would stay by, and get him to a place of safety.</p>
<p>First of all the young scout master started
to make an examination so that he might understand
the extent of the man&rsquo;s injuries.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it queer how history likes to repeat
itself?&rdquo; remarked Billy while he and the third
chum stood there watching Hugh go through
with this examination. &ldquo;Just the other day
it seems we saw our leader look over another
party who had met with an accident, only in
his case it was a fractured arm and not his
leg.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; added Arthur, &ldquo;an aeronaut in one
case, and the owner of a dancing bear this time.
They say extremes meet, and I guess that&rsquo;s so
with us. But it makes no difference who&rsquo;s in
pain and trouble, a scout has got to stand by
him; isn&rsquo;t that right, Hugh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every time,&rdquo; replied the scout master
promptly. &ldquo;I find that this man has broken a
bone in his left leg. I can feel it grate when
I press it, even if it hasn&rsquo;t come through, like
some do when the fracture is extra bad. But
he&rsquo;s been trying to stand on it, and drag himself
up here, only to fall back again and again,
so that it&rsquo;s pretty badly inflamed by now. Want
of attention has hurt him more than the original
break. I&rsquo;m going to fix that leg as best I
can, and wrap it up with the fresh surgeons&rsquo;
tape I happen to be carrying with me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<p>There was really no &ldquo;happen&rdquo; about it, for
Hugh always made it a point to carry a small
supply of that useful bandage tape with him
all the time. It is one of those things which
when required at all is needed badly. On several
previous occasions the scout master had
found cause to thank his forethought in thus
going prepared for emergencies. Boys take so
many desperate chances in their rough play
that they are in constant danger of meeting
with some accident.</p>
<p>The man seemed to understand that he was
in the hands of Good Samaritans, though it
doubtless hurt him keenly when Hugh worked;
he stifled many a groan, he gritted his teeth,
and managed to keep from fainting under the
strain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, that&rsquo;s all done, and as good a job
as anything I ever tackled,&rdquo; Hugh finally declared,
as he arose and stretched his cramped
limbs. &ldquo;And now the next thing is to get him
up out of here. Suppose both of you try taking
him by the shoulders while I look after his
legs. I know how to handle him with as little
pain as can be done. We can move him a
little way, and then rest, till we&rsquo;re up on the
level again. Ready, boys?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>The others understood what Hugh had in
mind. They had practiced carrying a helpless
person in some of their &ldquo;first aid to the injured&rdquo;
lessons; and hence were quite competent
to attend to their end. Hugh knew that
the wounded man was in for more painful experiences,
but then there was no other way of
getting him out of that deep gully.</p>
<p>Resting as many as half a dozen times, the
three scouts finally reached the level ground
again. All of them were panting heavily, for
the man was no light weight, and climbing the
steep side of the ravine under such conditions
was a much more difficult task than they had
found when descending.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now what?&rdquo; asked Billy as he looked
to Hugh to lay out a plan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must make a litter or stretcher, just
as we&rsquo;ve done more than a few times when
practicing this game of carrying a wounded
comrade,&rdquo; the scout master told them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p>&ldquo;That would be easy enough if only we had
some sort of hatchet along,&rdquo; Arthur declared,
&ldquo;but you see, none of us dreamed we&rsquo;d need
such a thing. Now, I&rsquo;ve got an old one hidden
near where my wireless masts stand up on the
top of Cedar Hill, if only you&rsquo;d wait till I
could go there and back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No need,&rdquo; observed Hugh, who had as
usual been keeping his eyes on the alert, and
made a few discoveries. &ldquo;Here are all the
poles we&rsquo;ll need, lying in a bunch. Probably
some fellow had been gathering them for bean
poles or something like that, and then forgot
to take them away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Talk to me about luck, we get it in hunks,
don&rsquo;t we?&rdquo; cried Billy. &ldquo;Why, where could
we have run across better poles to make a
stretcher? All we want is some stout cord
to fasten the ends together, so they won&rsquo;t slip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a piece of rope the bear man seemed
to have been carrying along with him for some
purpose or other,&rdquo; said Hugh. &ldquo;I picked it up
near where he lay, knowing we might make use
of it some way. By unwinding these strands
we&rsquo;ll have more than all the cord we need to
tie the poles across each other.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>All of them immediately busied themselves,
and so well had their lesson been learned that
in a very short time they had fashioned a splendid
litter. The wounded man watched them
work with a sparkle of gratitude in his eyes.
He must have realized by now that those khaki
uniforms which these boys wore meant succor
for him, and it is greatly to the credit of Boy
Scouts everywhere that seldom does this confidence
in their willingness to give aid in times
of distress meet with disappointment.</p>
<p>After the litter had been finished, they laid
enough hemlock browse upon it to make a
pretty soft mattress. As Billy felt of that and
scented the delightful piney odor, he nodded his
head and remarked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I only hope that if ever I break a leg and
have to be carried to the doctor&rsquo;s, I&rsquo;ll be lucky
enough to lie on as fine a stretcher as this,
that&rsquo;s all I can say.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p>Hugh took hold of one end, and Billy started
at the other. They meant to take turns and in
this way &ldquo;rest up,&rdquo; as Billy called it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re heading so as to reach the road, I
take it?&rdquo; remarked Arthur presently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what I&rsquo;m doing,&rdquo; the scout master replied.
&ldquo;We ought to make use of our wheels
in some way to take off most of the strain of
carrying this man to town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;d ever have thought of that but you,
Chief?&rdquo; cried Billy, who was looking a little
tired. The task of stumbling along, bearing
half of that weight over rough ground, was
far from an easy one.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>When they reached the spot where the bicycles
had been hidden these were brought out,
and it was found that the stretcher could be
rested on the handle bars of two of the wheels.
By taking care, there was little danger of an
upset. So presently a queer procession was
passing along the road. Everything seemed
to work so nicely that while they met several
farmers going home from market, the boys declined
the offer when they proposed turning
back so as to carry the wounded Russian to
the hospital.</p>
<p>Perhaps there was a little vein of pride
about it, and the scouts wanted to let scoffers
see how well they were able to manage when
a sudden emergency confronted them. They
were only boys after all, and felt that they had
a perfect right to be proud of the way they had
managed.</p>
<p>Hugh at such times as they paused&mdash;once
to rest and again to give the injured man a
drink from a spring that bubbled up near the
road&mdash;managed to converse a little with the
grateful fellow. He told the boy, whom he
now looked upon as a good and tried friend,
that he did have a little <i>cache</i> among the rocks
on the side of Stormberg, where he kept his
savings, being afraid to trust banks, and knowing
what danger there must always be of his
being robbed if he carried all his money along
with him in his erratic wanderings. For three
years he had come back here late every summer
and in the early spring to add secretly to
his hoard.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>On the present occasion it had been his intention
to carry his accumulations away with
him, for he meant to sail across the sea to his
old home, where he could live in what he considered
comfort on the amount he had saved.
Misfortune had overtaken him, however, and
with a broken leg he must delay his departure a
long time.</p>
<p>They reached the town limits at length, and
great was the surprise of the good citizens
when this queer ambulance took its way along
the main street, headed for the hospital. As
the excitement spread, people rushed out of
stores and dwelling houses, and upon every
tongue could be heard praises of the Boy
Scouts.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>&ldquo;What won&rsquo;t they be doing next?&rdquo; men
asked each other as they noted how splendidly
Hugh and his two chums had made that
stretcher for the wounded man, and how cleverly
they were utilizing their wheels in place
of a wagon in order to convey him from a
distance to the town hospital. &ldquo;It certainly
was the best thing that ever happened for the
boys of this country when that scout movement
started here, and it has spread like wildfire.
Why, it was only lately that they rescued
that aeronaut, and the doctor said they&rsquo;d fix
his broken arm about as well as he could have
done the job himself under the same conditions.
If your boy doesn&rsquo;t belong already, you
can&rsquo;t coax him to be a scout any too soon, believe
me, neighbor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having seen the wounded man safely cared
for, and received his thanks, uttered in broken
English it is true, but just as heartfelt for all
that, Hugh next thought of the bear, left there
in the hills. He hunted up a lot more of the
scouts who were of a stripe to enjoy any lark
of that kind, and armed with plenty of rope
they started forth.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<p>In the end they succeeded in bringing the
trained bear all the way back to town, and as
Hugh had been thoughtful enough to take
along a supply of food for the animal, the task
proved much easier than any of them had anticipated.
All they had to do was to keep him
well roped from several quarters, and then
tempt him to shuffle along by holding some of
the food so he could see it.</p>
<p>Their arrival created another furore. People
once more came flocking to the streets to watch
the little procession pass by. They were telling
each other that nowadays there hardly
seemed to arise any sort of necessity but what
somehow the Boy Scouts were being counted
on to meet and overcome the difficulty,&mdash;from
finding a lost child to rescuing a wrecked balloon
pilot or saving the life of a poor foreigner
who had fallen over a precipice and broken his
leg.</p>
<p>All of which must have been so intensely
gratifying to Hugh and his chums that the
fatigue caused by their strenuous exertions
was for the time being quite forgotten.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<h2 id="c6">CHAPTER VI.
<br /><span class="small">BILLY&rsquo;S LUCKY JINX.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;To-morrow is the day set for starting to
Boston to go aboard the Government vessel
handed over to the Naval Reserve for their
late summer cruise and practice, isn&rsquo;t it,
Hugh?&rdquo; remarked Billy Worth sadly on the
Monday following their adventure up on the
side of Cedar Hill and Stormberg Mountain.</p>
<p>He and Arthur happened to meet at Hugh&rsquo;s
house that afternoon to help the scout master
finish his packing, though that was probably
only an excuse to be in his society, for Hugh
was not the one to neglect the slightest thing,
or leave it to annoy him in the rush toward
the last moment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we leave on the ten-five morning train,
and will be aboard before sunset, if all goes
well,&rdquo; replied Hugh. &ldquo;I wish both of you were
going along; but as only two could be selected
from each patrol, and Billy just missed being
the second Wolf chosen, it can&rsquo;t be helped.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Worst streak of luck I ever ran up
against!&rdquo; declared that individual with a look
of supreme disgust on his face. &ldquo;Just a measly
five points stood between me and that dandy
cruise. Oh! I&rsquo;ll never get over it, I tell you.
Slowly but surely I&rsquo;m crumbling away, losing
flesh every single day, until when you come
back none of you&rsquo;ll recognize me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hugh only chuckled at hearing this, but Arthur
jeered the speaker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, my word for it you can keep on
&lsquo;crumbling&rsquo; like you say you are, for the next
sixteen years and then beat me in weight two
to one. Crumbling agrees with some people,
it seems. But besides you and Andy Scott,
who&rsquo;s on the lucky list, Hugh? I&rsquo;ve been feeling
so bad about it, and so busy working on
my wireless, that I haven&rsquo;t paid much attention
to these other things lately.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<p>&ldquo;From the Hawks there are Walter Osborne
and Blake Merton; from the Fox Patrol Don
Miller and that new member who took the
place of the one moving away from our town;
and they do say that &lsquo;Monkey&rsquo; Stallings has
belonged to a New York troop&mdash;he is entitled
to wear the badge of a first class scout&mdash;and
certainly gave Don a close race for first honors
in the examination. Then from the Otters
of course there will be Alec Sands and
with him Sam Winter. That makes the full
eight boys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how about the Owl Patrol; don&rsquo;t they
send representatives along too?&rdquo; asked Arthur,
surprised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Hugh replied, &ldquo;because it was stipulated
that only first-class scouts could go on
this great voyage up the coast with the Naval
Reserve; and you know that nearly all of
our new members belonging to the Owl Patrol
are tenderfeet, fellows who have a lot to
learn before they can call themselves real
scouts.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad that you think I have done a
pretty decent job with my affair up at the
Cedar Hill Station of the wireless circuit,
Hugh,&rdquo; remarked Arthur.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was only what I expected to find. I happened
to know what a clever hand you were
at all such contraptions, Arthur,&rdquo; the scout
master told him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And to think how fortunate it was that we
were all there just when my aerials were working
in sympathy with that Government station
over on the coast near Cape Cod,&rdquo; continued
the other with a happy light dancing in his
eyes. &ldquo;Say, let me tell you it was the proudest
time of my whole life when I stood there
and actually read a part of that Marconigram
sent from the beach station to some other point,
telling about a wreck that had happened on
the coast. What was better, each of you had
the pleasure of listening to some of that message
too, sent a hundred miles away from
here.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Hugh, &ldquo;and that was further
than I had ever heard a message before by
wireless. One thing seems sure, Arthur, if
they let us get in touch with you, we can have
great times while we&rsquo;re away from home. And
that code you gave me will enable us to simplify
matters just fine. A letter stands for a
sentence to the home folks, and every one of
us has a particular sign. By the way, who&rsquo;s
heard the latest news about our friend, the
Russian bear man, and his pet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody was saying at our house they
heard he meant to be around on crutches soon,&rdquo;
remarked Billy, &ldquo;but we happen to know the
reason he won&rsquo;t leave town till he can pay
another visit up there to the rocky side of old
Stormberg. He wants to gather in that snug
little nest egg he&rsquo;s got hidden away there. He
sold his bear to the park people, who are thinking
of starting a sort of zoo, you must know,
to interest the children and teach them more
about wild animals than they can ever get
from traveling shows.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad of that,&rdquo; Hugh observed. &ldquo;Whenever
any of us happens to be in the park we
can give the old chap some peanuts, and remember
the great times we had up there when
we found him hitched to that tree, and as hungry
as they make them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder if he&rsquo;ll always look at me the same
way he did then,&rdquo; mused Billy as he rubbed
his chin reflectively. &ldquo;Honest, fellows, I believe
only for that loaf of Mrs. Benton&rsquo;s home-made
bread that I tossed him as a coaxer, he&rsquo;d
have taken a nab at one of my legs. But we
did our duty as scouts, didn&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, we found a hungry and thirsty bear
tied up, and not only fetched him water in our
hats but fed him with the best there was,&rdquo; Arthur
went on to say in a tone that was full of
boyish satisfaction. &ldquo;Then not only that but
we tracked his master, and rescued him from
that bad hole, fixed his broken leg, toted him
all the way to the hospital on a stretcher that
only scouts would know how to make, and then
brought the bear down in the bargain. I&rsquo;m
glad I took my camera that last time because
I got a dandy picture of him standing on his
hind legs and dancing, holding that long pole
all the while. I have to laugh every time I
look at that picture, boys. It enlarges fine, and
some day I&rsquo;ll print each of you one six inches
square, because all three of us are in the picture,
along with Dancing Jumbo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good of you to make such an offer,
Arthur,&rdquo; avowed Billy, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ve got just the
right place to put it over the desk in my den.
It&rsquo;s fine to have something to show for your
work, and a picture is the best every time.
When you look at it you seem to be living the
whole thing over again. That album of yours
is something I never get tired of hanging over
whenever I&rsquo;m at your house. What great times
it covers, and how some of those adventures
stand out, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>&ldquo;How about that new member of the Foxes,
Monkey Stallings, though I believe he is called
Eben at home? Have you seen enough of him
to know whether he&rsquo;s going to make a good
addition to our troop, Hugh?&rdquo; Arthur asked,
changing the subject.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know that he&rsquo;s seen more or less service
as a scout, and that counts for considerable,
you know,&rdquo; the patrol leader answered.
&ldquo;Somehow I haven&rsquo;t happened to see enough
of him at close quarters to say I know him
real well. He&rsquo;s a regular gymnast and contortionist,
they tell me, and can hang from the
highest limb of a tree by his toes without a
quiver, climb like a regular monkey, stand on
his head as well as walk on his hands or his
toes as it pleases him. In fact, he&rsquo;s a bundle
of nerves, and can hardly keep quiet.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you&rsquo;ll be apt to know him better
by the time you get back from this gay cruise,&rdquo;
Billy told him. &ldquo;Don Miller seems to think
he&rsquo;s the best thing that&rsquo;s struck the troop this
season, and I reckon he ought to know. But
isn&rsquo;t there anything I could help you do in
packing your outfit, Hugh? If I can&rsquo;t go along
myself, the next best thing is to have a hand
in getting you ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a single thing left to do, Billy,&rdquo; the
scout master assured him. &ldquo;You see, I made
out this little list, taking along only what I
must have. We got pointers about that from
Lieutenant Denmead, who was afraid some of
the boys would load themselves down with all
sorts of truck from camping stuff to banjoes.
I checked things off as I put them in my knapsack,
and it&rsquo;s all there with my blanket. When
the time comes to say good-by, I&rsquo;ll be ready to
shoulder this and be off.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<p>Billy drew a tremendous sigh that seemed
to come straight from his big heart. If he
had ever been grievously disappointed in his
life, it was right when Hugh and those seven
other lucky fellows were about starting off on
what promised to be a most glorious cruise on
salt water, and he had to stay home all through
those two long dreary weeks, just going along
in the same old rut day after day with nothing
exciting happening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s somebody ringing your &rsquo;phone bell
like fun, Hugh!&rdquo; remarked Arthur.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so, and I forgot that about everybody
happens to be out now; so I&rsquo;d better go
and attend to it myself. Excuse me, boys, I&rsquo;ll
be back in a jiffy.&rdquo; And with these words
Hugh hurried into the hall where the telephone
hung.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<p>They heard him talking with some one, but
paid little or no attention to what was going
on. Arthur was examining some pictures he
had run across on Hugh&rsquo;s table taken by a
cousin out West, which depicted cowboy
scenes that stirred the blood of the boy, who
loved life in the open. Billy on his part was
studying the list mentioned by Hugh, which
had a blue pencil check against every item; and
he seemed so intent on this labor that one
might even think he contemplated packing his
own knapsack, waylaying the column somewhere,
and forcibly taking the place of some
other scout.</p>
<p>When Hugh came back, his face was shining
and his eyes dancing so that both of the
other boys guessed he must have been hearing
some very pleasant news over the wire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who was it, and what did they want?&rdquo;
asked Arthur with a chum&rsquo;s familiarity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was Lieutenant Denmead,&rdquo; replied
Hugh, still smiling broadly as he looked
straight at Billy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did he want with you, Hugh, tell
us?&rdquo; appealed Arthur. &ldquo;It had something to
do with that trip to-morrow, didn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a good guesser, Arthur&mdash;it certainly
did,&rdquo; Hugh told him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, I hope there hasn&rsquo;t been any
fluke, or that something&rsquo;s happened to block
the game?&rdquo; Billy exclaimed, though he ought
to have known that such a dreadful disaster
would never have made Hugh grin as he was
doing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has been blocked for one scout, it appears,
because his folks have decided at the
last minute they don&rsquo;t want him to go,&rdquo; Hugh
explained. &ldquo;You see his brother was drowned
only last summer, and they tremble at the
thought of their only boy spending two long
weeks aboard a boat at sea and in the coast
harbors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Billy became almost white as he clutched the
arm of the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A boy drowned, did you say, Hugh? Why,
that must be Benjy Scott you&rsquo;re referring to!
Am I right, Hugh? Oh! please hurry and tell
me, for I&rsquo;m nearly choking with suspense. Because
you see it was his brother, Andy Scott,
that just nosed me out of going on this bully
trip. Is <i>Andy</i> the one that&rsquo;s had to back down?
Is that what our scout master said, Hugh?
Tell me!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<p>&ldquo;That was what happened, Billy,&rdquo; replied
the other as he held out his hand to the excited
boy, &ldquo;and when he tried to get you at your
home, they said you were probably over here.
Anyway, the lieutenant told me that as you
were a close <i>third</i> on the list, and as Andy
couldn&rsquo;t go along with the rest, I was commissioned
to say that the place was open to
you, if you cared to accept!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>&ldquo;What, me accept?&rdquo; gasped Billy, beginning
to recover his usual rosy color as the delightful
prospect arose before him. &ldquo;Why, I&rsquo;d stay
up half the night getting my pack ready so I
wouldn&rsquo;t miss that train! Whoop! think of
it, will you! I&rsquo;m to go along after all? The
same old lucky jinx is playing his tricks on
me. Hugh, loan me this list of yours; it will
save me lots of trouble. And where&rsquo;s my hat?
I ought to slide over home in three shakes of
a wolf&rsquo;s tail and get busy packing up. No
sleep for me to-night, I&rsquo;m afraid, with my
nerves all singing little songs of joy like they
are right now. If I don&rsquo;t see you again, Arthur,
till at the train, here&rsquo;s the best of luck
to you with your wireless! Be sure to stay up
around that tree station every day you can!
We&rsquo;ll try our level best to talk with you. Just
to think how things change around! One minute
I was eating my heart out with envy, and
now I know I&rsquo;m going along. Whoop! don&rsquo;t
stop me&mdash;I&rsquo;m off!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<h2 id="c7">CHAPTER VII.
<br /><span class="small">&ldquo;ALL ABOARD!&rdquo;</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;That was the go-ashore whistle, Hugh! It
means we&rsquo;re due to leave the dock in five or
ten minutes more!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And still nothing to be seen of those two
hold-out scouts, Sam Winter and the latest recruit,
Monkey Stallings. I&rsquo;m beginning to believe
they&rsquo;ve got adrift seeing the sights of
old Boston, and will lose the number of their
mess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What fools some fellows can be, Hugh!
As for me, now that I&rsquo;m on the deck of this
bully boat, nothing could hire me to go ashore
again till the cruise is over. A life on the wide,
wide sea for me, tral-la-la!&rdquo; and Billy Worth
danced a few steps as though he might already
imagine himself a seasoned old salt practicing
what is known as the &ldquo;sailor&rsquo;s hornpipe.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<p>&ldquo;Better wait and see before you boast too
loud, Billy,&rdquo; returned the scout master, grimly.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard about all sorts of terrible
things that happen to landsmen the first time
they feel the roll of the ship under them. Solid
earth may seem like the finest thing you can
think of before many hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh! don&rsquo;t make me out a regular greeny,
Chief. Remember I&rsquo;ve sailed on a bay before.
I reckon some fellows with weak stomachs
will double up; but it&rsquo;s different with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You never can tell,&rdquo; Hugh remarked dryly.
&ldquo;So I say it&rsquo;s wise not to blow your horn too
loud before you know. But whatever can be
keeping those boys? Looks as if we might
only count six noses at roll-call instead of the
full eight.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<p>The two members of the Wolf Patrol were
leaning over the side of the Government vessel
of the type known as a scout cruiser. This one
had been fitted up especially for the convenience
and education of the young jack tars who
thronged the deck and the dock nearby, dressed
for the most part in white togs, and with all
the airs of experienced sea-going mariners.</p>
<p>These jaunty looking fellows constituted a
branch of the auxiliary arm of the United
States Government known as the Naval Reserve,
upon which Uncle Sam expected to call
immediately should any war break out, to man
his extra ships, and defend the coasts against
an enemy.</p>
<p>They were from all walks of life, and as a
rule bright, eager young men who knew considerable
about what the duties aboard a warship
were like. They had nearly all been afloat
on preceding summers, since this cruise was a
regular institution. Still, they desired to learn
all possible new wrinkles connected with their
vocation as voluntary naval men; and the two
weeks&rsquo; cruise along the New England coast
was going to widen their knowledge wonderfully.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<p>Just what the Boy Scouts were expected to
do aboard the <i>Vixen</i>, Hugh did not as yet fully
know. It was supposed, however, that they
would be very useful in many capacities, especially
when landing parties went ashore, defended
by the big guns of the cruiser, with
a force concealed behind land defenses to carry
out the part of a hostile army.</p>
<p>It had all been a piece of tremendous good
luck, this chance that came to some of the
scouts to accompany the Naval Reserve on
this summer cruise. Such a thing had, so far
as Hugh knew, never been dreamed of before;
and it all came about through the gratitude of
the rich aeronaut, Mr. Perkins, whom Hugh
and several of his chums had rescued from the
top of a tall tree, where he had been stranded
when his runaway balloon lurched and threw
him out.</p>
<p>It seemed that he was a personal friend of
the Secretary of the Navy; in fact they had
been old-time chums in their school days. And
Professor Perkins had used his influence with
the Naval Department so as to have this wonderful
invitation extended to the troop in which
he had taken such a keen interest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<p>The scouts had all left the home town on the
scheduled train, and before five that evening
were aboard the cruiser, wild with delight over
the prospect that loomed up ahead. They were
given quarters forward with the men, and being
accustomed to camping, believed they
would be able to make themselves very comfortable
while sleeping in hammocks.</p>
<p>And indeed, that night they had no complaint
to make, though it did seem pretty noisy
around the docks, especially to lads accustomed
to the quiet of country life.</p>
<p>On the following day they were allowed
shore leave with explicit instructions to be
aboard at one o&rsquo;clock, since that was close to
the hour set for sailing; and as Hugh put it,
&ldquo;neither time, nor tide, nor yet Government
war vessels wait for any man.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>Here one o&rsquo;clock had come, and as yet two
of the scouts had failed to show up, so that
Hugh was naturally bothered, for he considered
this tardiness inexcusable in boys who
had been taught the value of keeping their
engagements to the letter.</p>
<p>All of the other scouts had lined up on that
side of the vessel with scores of the Naval
Reserves, deeply interested in what was going
on. As is usually the case when a boat is due
to move out, there was great confusion.
Trucks were being rushed this way and that,
to get some late luggage or food supplies
aboard; officers were shouting orders; men
bidding good-by to wives and friends; and
all in all, it was a sight the boys would never
be apt to forget no matter what they might
experience in coming days, such an indelible
impression did it make on their young minds.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<p>Again did the long and shrill whistle start
blowing with frequent breaks. The Reserves,
knowing that this meant &ldquo;all aboard,&rdquo; broke
away from the various little groups on the
crowded dock and started up the gangways.
Gradually order was coming out of apparent
chaos, and it could be seen that every man was
now aboard the <i>Vixen</i>; the vessel trembled
from the escaping steam that roared like a
giant, impatient to be off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too bad,&rdquo; said Hugh, as this racket suddenly
ceased, and he saw the men begin to
unfasten the heavy hawsers that held the
cruiser close to the wharf. &ldquo;Those fellows
have missed the chance of their lives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look! there comes one on the run!&rdquo; exclaimed
Walter Osborne near by.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Sam Winter, and he&rsquo;ll just make it,
and no more!&rdquo; echoed Alec Sands, who probably
felt a deeper interest in the success or
failure of the runner than any of the other
boys, since he and Sam represented the Otter
Patrol aboard.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<p>The six scouts started a cheer to encourage
the runner, and recognizing the familiar signal
of the scout&rsquo;s troop, Sam looked up and
waved his hand. He just managed to set his
foot on the last gangway as it trembled on the
rise; and the next moment was dragged aboard
the boat, saved by an inch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That makes seven, anyhow!&rdquo; said Billy.
&ldquo;But that new recruit, Monkey Stallings, is
left in the lurch. Wow! what&rsquo;s that I see back
yonder, Hugh? Looks mighty like a scout in
uniform breaking through the crowd, doesn&rsquo;t
it? Say, they&rsquo;ve gone and got that boy blocked
so he just can&rsquo;t make it in time! Now isn&rsquo;t
that too bad? Whatever can he do, I&rsquo;d like
to know? So near and yet so far, with the
boat beginning to move out, too. Poor Monkey,
I&rsquo;m sorry for you, sure I am!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! look at that! Look at him, boys!&rdquo;
shrieked Blake Merton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to be a cold day when Monkey
gets left, let me tell you!&rdquo; cried Don Miller,
who, being the leader of the Fox Patrol, to
which the new recruit belonged, probably knew
more about the varied accomplishments of
Monkey than any other scout.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<p>Seeing that he had no chance to break
through the solid crowd that barred his passage,
the recruit had leaped up to the top of a
pile of freight on the dock, and was even then
skipping along almost over the heads of the
dense mass of cheering spectators, clinging to
all sorts of friendly objects, and exhibiting
a nimbleness that caused his seven comrades
fairly to hold their breath.</p>
<p>The entire crowd had by this time begun to
understand that one of the Boy Scouts was
in danger of being left behind; and like all
crowds, this one started to send out volleys
of encouraging shouts amidst much laughter.
For the moment even bitter partings were utterly
forgotten; everyone present became vitally
interested in whether the daring and nimble
lad was going to make it or not.</p>
<p>Monkey had apparently sized up the situation
at a single glance. All of his efforts were
directed to reaching the end of the pier in time
to make a wild leap as the boat swept past,
for she was going out stern first as was customary.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<p>There never was greater excitement over the
sailing of a vessel with a consignment of the
Naval Reserve aboard, and all on account of
one belated passenger who seemed bent on
making a last desperate effort not to be left.
The sympathies of every witness had been
aroused, and encouraging cheers doubtless
nerved the boy to even greater exertions.</p>
<p>As the crisis came, Hugh became rigid with
anxiety, for it looked nip and tuck as to
whether Monkey would land on the boat or
drop with a splash in Boston harbor.</p>
<p>Monkey managed to catch hold of the rail,
and clung there like a squirrel does to the trunk
of a tree while cheer after cheer greeted the
successful carrying out of the daring act. And
then friendly jackies reached down to lift him
over, for it seemed as though every fellow
aboard felt that he would be glad to give the
plucky scout a helping hand.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<p>Of course the other boys considered that
Monkey&rsquo;s achievement shed more or less luster
on the entire organization; and for the next
half hour they felt themselves of considerable
importance aboard that boat, and doubtless
puffed out their chests more or less in consequence.</p>
<p>Alas! pride is often doomed to have a fall,
and it was almost due in this case, though few
of those lads suspected from what quarter their
Waterloo was fated to come.</p>
<p>They sat there looking back at the beautiful
scene, as the <i>Vixen</i> passed down the harbor.
Bunker Hill monument stood up like a finger
pointing to the heavens, and as all the boys had
climbed to its top the first thing that morning,
they paid more attention to this than any other
feature that opened before them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s Nantasket Beach!&rdquo; they heard
someone, who was probably a Boston man, say
near by, as he pointed to a strip of shore that
seemed to be given up to all manner of merry-go-rounds,
Ferris wheels, and the like, to be
found at shore resorts such as have become
known under the name of &ldquo;Coney Islands.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry we didn&rsquo;t have time to run down
there,&rdquo; remarked Billy, who was moving uneasily
about along the deck. &ldquo;Mebbe we&rsquo;ll get
a chance to do it when we come back. Let&rsquo;s
see, that will be in about twelve days, won&rsquo;t it,
Hugh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but I hope you&rsquo;re not counting the
days already, Billy?&rdquo; remarked the other with
a twinkle in his eye, for he suspected what
was coming.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, me? Well, I should guess not. If
it was forty days, it would make me all the
happier. But we must be getting out to sea,
aren&rsquo;t we, Hugh? The boat has begun to dip
the queer way they told me it would when it
had left the harbor behind. And say, what an
odd, nasty motion it has, too?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! let up on that, Billy! Just as if we
don&rsquo;t know it without you forcing the fact in
our faces,&rdquo; Walter Osborne told him, for
Walter was sitting there, holding his head in
his hands, and apparently trying to keep from
seeing how things had begun to move up and
down in that dizzy fashion.</p>
<p>As the roll of the sea became more pronounced,
for it was rather rough outside, first
one fellow and then another made some silly
excuse and slipped away. Several of the Reserves
seemed to be deeply interested in the
green water and the white foam under the
vessel&rsquo;s side, for they kept leaning over steadily.</p>
<p>Hugh was really the last to give in, and he
only felt that he ought to be looking after the
other fellows who had gone below to their
hammocks. He found every one of the seven
there &ldquo;taking things easy&rdquo; they assured him,
though several had white faces, and their merriment
was rather forced.</p>
<p>When supper time came along, Hugh and
Alec Sands were the only scouts who cared
to answer the bugle call and attend mess; and
even they did not seem to have the customary
scout appetite of which they had once been so
proud.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<h2 id="c8">CHAPTER VIII.
<br /><span class="small">AFLOAT WITH THE NAVAL MILITIA.</span></h2>
<p>As a rule boys seem to recover from seasickness
much sooner than older people. While
several of the scouts still looked a bit &ldquo;peaked,&rdquo;
and seemed to have only a shadow of their
former appetite on the first morning out, Hugh
knew they were coming around bravely. Before
that day ended they would be all right,
having adjusted themselves to the motion of
the vessel.</p>
<p>With such a delightful experience before
them, it would have been strange indeed if any
fellow could have allowed himself to be chained
down by such a small thing. And a determination
to overcome the distressing malady is
after all half the battle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<p>The <i>Vixen</i> was heading almost due north.
It was no part of the commander&rsquo;s plan of
campaign to go very far out of sight of land
at any time. The annual practice of the naval
militia is only entered into with the idea of
giving the boys a certain amount of familiarity
with handling a war vessel and all that this
implies.</p>
<p>Uncle Sam does not expect to man all his
battleships, cruisers, torpedo boats and other
fighting craft in the piping times of peace. It
would be altogether unnecessary and at the
same time very expensive. From time to time
some of these grim vessels of war are laid up
in the various Government yards, either undergoing
repairs or just standing idle.</p>
<p>At such times their former crews are distributed
around on other boats, or else discharged,
the time of the enlistment of the men
having expired. In case a sudden need should
arise for manning these idle craft, the services
of the Naval Reserve would become very
valuable. Uncle Sam recognizes this fact, and
in gratitude to the young men who form the
main part of the reserve corps, extends every
facility possible toward making their several
weeks&rsquo; practice afloat of real benefit.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>On the <i>Vixen</i> they took almost sole charge,
and with a few seasoned officers to superintend
things, pursued a systematic course of
drill that would enable them to man a cruiser
or a torpedo boat during war times with the
skill of regulars.</p>
<p>Besides this they showed the utmost enthusiasm
in their work that was most promising.
Their time being so short, and all these things
so new and novel, the practice took on the
atmosphere of a holiday rather than a working
period. Perhaps had they been compelled to
look forward to three long years of the same
sort of thing, they might not have enjoyed it
half so well.</p>
<p>As that first day wore on some of the scouts
began to show signs of disappointment. There
seemed to be next to nothing that they could
do aboard but watch the drills of the Reserve
men; and to boys that soon becomes tiresome
since they aspire to have a hand in whatever
is going on.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<p>It is true that they learned many valuable
things connected with the working of a war
vessel, all of which would remain pleasant
memories long after this cruise had become a
thing of the past. The clever way in which
the crew was piped to quarters as an enemy&rsquo;s
vessel was supposed to be sighted ahead, being
really a floating target previously arranged
and anchored, was thrilling in the extreme.
And then, as the guns with which the <i>Vixen</i>
was armed began to thunder, with the water
flying up like a big geyser whenever the shot
struck alongside the wooden target&mdash;would
they ever forget how it made their ears ring
for hours!</p>
<p>Since the percentage of &ldquo;hits&rdquo; turned out
to be larger than ever before in a given number
of shots, everybody aboard was in fine humor.
Only some of the scouts pulled long faces, because
they did not have a share in the grand
work.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<p>Hugh had been talking with the commander,
however, for whom he conceived a great liking,
and was in a position to cheer up the drooping
spirits of these grumblers, of whom Alec
Sands and Billy Worth were the chief offenders.</p>
<p>The scout master managed to get all of the
fellows forward where they would not be in
the way. At the time they were within plain
sight of the coast, and the sea happened to be
fairly smooth so that even the sickest of the
scouts had become himself again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You fellows must stop looking as though
you felt sorry you&rsquo;d come,&rdquo; Hugh told them.
&ldquo;Just see what we&rsquo;ve learned already, and
there are heaps of other things on the program
that we&rsquo;ve read all about, never thinking
we&rsquo;d have a chance to see with our own eyes
how they were done. Just feel that salty air,
will you? It makes me sniff right along, as
if I couldn&rsquo;t get enough of it. Now I know
what ails the lot of you; and let me say right
here that in good time we&rsquo;re going to have
our share in this war game!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<p>&ldquo;Bully for you, Hugh!&rdquo; exclaimed Billy, forgetting
the respect due to the assistant scout
master, which lack, however, went unnoticed
in the general eagerness to learn what Hugh
meant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve had chances to pick up information,&rdquo;
remarked Alec, in an aggrieved tone,
as though he could not get over being jealous
of Hugh&rsquo;s having been placed in the high position
he occupied, &ldquo;that none of the rest of
us could command. I&rsquo;ve seen you chatting
time and again with the captain of the crew
in charge here.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s where I got my information,&rdquo; replied
the other smilingly. &ldquo;You see, Captain
Conrad had met our friend, Professor Perkins,
and I guess he told him a lot about what
the scouts have done in the past, for he mentioned
several things, and asked me a lot of
questions about how they really happened. To-morrow&rsquo;s
program, if the weather permits,
covers several maneuvers, the principal one of
which is torpedo-launching practice. You
know they have two tubes arranged for that
very purpose aboard the <i>Vixen</i>, though as a
rule scout cruisers don&rsquo;t go in much for that
sort of thing, depending on their speed to work
damage, and surprise the enemy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Torpedo practice, hey?&rdquo; cried Billy, always
having something to say. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a thing
I always wanted to see done, and I&rsquo;ll be tickled
half to death to get the chance right now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what part do we take in the game, Mr.
Scout Master?&rdquo; asked Alec with just the
slightest sneer in his voice as he pronounced
the title. He had long ago convinced himself
that the boys had made a great mistake when
they selected Hugh to that high office and that
his own general knowledge of scoutcraft
should have entitled him to holding it, instead.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; added Monkey Stallings, &ldquo;do we play
the part of the torpedo, or the whale that we
used to sing about, you remember in &lsquo;Pinafore&rsquo;?
I don&rsquo;t care who acts as the big fish
so long as I&rsquo;m allowed to be the shooting stick
that gallops through the water and rams things
in its way. You want to give Captain Conrad
a hint that I&rsquo;d make the finest torpedo in the
bunch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess that&rsquo;s right, Monkey,&rdquo; laughed Don
Miller, who thought the new recruit as comical
a specimen as he had ever met, and was
never tired of being amused by his remarks
and antics. &ldquo;If they chucked you into a torpedo
tube and shot you out headed for a hostile
ship there&rsquo;d sure be something doing right
away. You&rsquo;d beat any old torpedo that ever
wiggled its way under water. But we can&rsquo;t
spare you, Monkey. We need you to keep the
blues away, don&rsquo;t we, fellows?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<p>&ldquo;So say we all of us!&rdquo; declared Sam Winter.
&ldquo;But, Hugh, you haven&rsquo;t told us if we&rsquo;re
going to have any part in the torpedo-launching
practice?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing to count for much, I&rsquo;m sorry to
say,&rdquo; replied the leader. &ldquo;The boats are sent
out to recover the torpedo that has been shot
and some of us may be allowed to go along.
Our time comes on the third day!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That sounds more like it, Chief!&rdquo; exclaimed
Billy gleefully. &ldquo;Please let us know what the
program calls for then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know,&rdquo; said Hugh, &ldquo;that the Coast
Artillery have their summer maneuvers about
this time, and it happens that some of the boys
are occupying a certain fort not more than
fifty miles away from here, practicing firing at
a target away out on the water with some of
the big coast defense disappearing guns of a
modern make.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I begin to smell a rat!&rdquo; Blake Merton
exclaimed, his face lighting up with sudden
enthusiasm and hope.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it has been arranged as a part of the
practice for both arms of the Government service
that the Naval Reservists try to take the
fort by surprise. Of course the defenders will
be on the watch every minute, and it is a part
of the game that if those aboard the <i>Vixen</i>
manage to get within a certain distance unobserved,
after making a landing under cover of
darkness, they will be credited with a victory;
while the Coast Battery must be given a black
mark. Well, that&rsquo;s where the commander
gave me to understand the scouts might be
used to good advantage!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on and tell us some more, Chief! You&rsquo;ve
got the whole bunch worked up to fever pitch
right now!&rdquo; urged Billy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are we to be detailed to take the fort by
creeping up in the dark?&rdquo; questioned Walter
Osborne, plainly very much excited at the
idea of such a thrilling episode. If successful,
it would go down in history as a gallant deed,
and perhaps engrave their names on the scroll
of fame alongside that of Paul Revere, he
thought.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<p>&ldquo;Remember that I&rsquo;m a champion crawler!&rdquo;
admonished Monkey, who evidently did not
believe in keeping his light hidden under a
bushel and felt that no one could blow his
horn so well as himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The plans have not all been worked out
yet,&rdquo; Hugh told them, &ldquo;but from certain things
the captain let fall, I&rsquo;m of the opinion the
scouts will be set ashore at some secret cove
with instructions to make their way up the
beach unobserved until they can spy on the
fort. After that I reckon it&rsquo;s up to them to
have a series of posts, so that they can send
the news flashing down the line. The scout
who is furthest south can relay it aboard where
one of our number will be waiting to take the
messages. In that way you see it will be all
scout work from beginning to end. If only
the fellows at the head can find out the weak
points of the defense of the fort, the Naval
Reserve men can capture the place as easy as
you please.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">108</div>
<p>&ldquo;It sounds like the boss scheme, Chief,&rdquo;
Billy admitted. &ldquo;And please don&rsquo;t pick me out
to stay aboard while the rest of you have such
a glorious time ashore, with chances of your
being captured by the enemy and put in the
darkest dungeon under the magazine of the
fort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You forget that the one who does have to
stay will occupy a post of honor,&rdquo; Hugh told
him. &ldquo;The receiving of the messages will depend
on the able way he takes them, whether
by heliograph or wigwag work. And besides,
a scout always stands ready to do his duty,
however disagreeable it may seem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I reckon I&rsquo;d look at it that way if I <i>had</i>
to,&rdquo; admitted Billy, &ldquo;but I only hope I&rsquo;m lucky
enough to be one of the shore party, that&rsquo;s
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, if only Arthur were along,&rdquo; said Don
Miller. &ldquo;He might get up some kind of a
scheme to work his wireless on this job. We&rsquo;ve
got the fixtures right on board here,&rdquo; and as
he spoke he glanced upward to where the delicate
antennae of the naval outfit could be seen
strung like spiders&rsquo; web tracery between the
wireless masts of the <i>Vixen</i>.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">109</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe that would answer,&rdquo; said
Hugh. &ldquo;There&rsquo;d be too much chance of the
enemy discovering our tall masts. The relay
system is better all around. Besides it gives
us scouts an opening to show what we can do.
When the full plans are worked out I&rsquo;ll be in
a position to tell you more. By then, too, I&rsquo;ll
have decided just what part each scout is to
have in the game. And now let&rsquo;s go aft to see
what&rsquo;s the next thing on the program for to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a-hopin&rsquo; it&rsquo;ll be that sweet bugle call,&rdquo;
sighed Billy as he rubbed a hand over his stomach.
&ldquo;Beats all how keen this salt air makes
a fellow. Seems like I could begin one meal
where the other left off. A little seasickness
must be a sort of tonic calculated to build up
poor appetites.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that remark the others broke out into a
jeering laugh that indicated that they did not
believe the speaker could be so afflicted.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<h2 id="c9">CHAPTER IX.
<br /><span class="small">THE NIGHT LANDING OF THE SCOUTS.</span></h2>
<p>Another day saw the scouts feeling more
like seasoned veterans. The motion of the vessel
no longer had any terrors for the weakest
among them, even though it chanced that in
the afternoon the ocean began to get so rough
that the boat fairly wallowed in the seas.</p>
<p>Luckily the commander had chosen to select
the morning hours for the torpedo-launching
practice, and it proved of considerable interest
to the boys. They were on hand to see
everything that was done, and they did not
hesitate to ask many questions readily answered
by the young men who made up the
Reserve crew.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<p>Hugh had cautioned the others to try and
make good friends of the men who temporarily
manned the <i>Vixen</i>, the vessel having been
given completely over into their charge for
the entire two weeks. This bore good fruit,
and the wearers of the khaki suits had become
prime favorites at every mess. Indeed, they
were known to have already had considerable
experience for boys, and of course it took very
little urging to coax any one of them to relate
some of the things that had come their way
in the past, with which most of our readers
are already familiar.</p>
<p>All of the scouts were really glad when
night again set in, with half a gale blowing
and the cruiser heading for an anchorage in
a certain harbor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If this keeps up to-morrow, good-bye to our
hopes of being set ashore on the coast,&rdquo; Alec
told several of the others as they gathered
around some of the crew who were bent on
having a pleasant evening, discipline having
been relaxed for a spell in order to ease the
strain under which they were laboring.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">112</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; added Walter, &ldquo;because they couldn&rsquo;t
take chances of launching a boat to land us
without danger of a capsize in the surf. It&rsquo;s
nice and quiet back of this point, but you can
hear the sea smashing up against the rocks
out there right along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there&rsquo;s no storm coming because Hugh
told me he saw the barometer, and it reads
well up to thirty, which means fair weather,
though windy,&rdquo; Don Miller went on to say,
and the information brought fresh hope to the
rest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like as not the breeze will have gone down
more or less before night sets in again,&rdquo; Blake
Merton gave as his opinion, though of course
it was mere guesswork, as he did not pretend
to be a weather prophet, and knew nothing,
about the signs on the sea, even if he were
something of a woodsman ashore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a fact,&rdquo; Alec remarked. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t
land till long after dark, I understand. So
there&rsquo;s plenty of time for it to quiet down.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<p>&ldquo;And to-morrow Hugh says the commander
promised that he&rsquo;d give a try to see if our
Arthur can be reached by wireless,&rdquo; Billy announced
with considerable pride. He had at
various times assisted Arthur in perfecting his
station on the crown of Cedar Hill, and Billy
had some sort of proprietary rights in the
wireless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, for the honor of the troop I certainly
hope they get in touch with Arthur,&rdquo; Alec
observed. He showed signs of envy and jealousy
at times, but when his old nature got the
upper hand of him, the leader of the Otters
was really proud of the organization to which
he belonged, and would exert himself manfully
in order to reflect credit on the name of a
scout.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<p>&ldquo;More than that, Hugh says,&rdquo; Billy went on,
seeming to have been delegated to act as the
mouthpiece of the scout master in order to
convey all this important news. &ldquo;The captain
promised him that if we did our part of
the landing game all right, he&rsquo;d allow us to
have half an hour&rsquo;s talk with our comrade at
home every day that the wireless could be used.
So that&rsquo;s a spur to make us try to do our best,
fellows, to spy on the fort defenders, and get
the information aboard without making mistakes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; added Don, &ldquo;and we ought to go into
this business seriously, too. No careless
handling of messages will pass when so much
depends on accuracy. Every fellow must be
up on his toes, and bent on doing his level best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are right there, Don,&rdquo; echoed Blake
Merton. &ldquo;We want to show these Reserve
men that scouts can do things right up to the
handle. Our signal corps work was always
first class. Just now I kind of wish we had
Bud Morgan along, because he worked with a
surveying party, too, you remember, and is
familiar with the business.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! don&rsquo;t let that bother you any,&rdquo; Alec
told him jauntily. &ldquo;There are others besides
Bud Morgan who know the ins and outs of
wigwag work, telegraphing, and the use of the
mirror in the sun that we call heliographing.
Why, there isn&rsquo;t a fellow in our bunch aboard
this boat but who can stand his spell with the
flags, and make mighty few blunders, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Alec, for the taffy,&rdquo; chuckled
Billy, &ldquo;but we ought to be up in that sort of
work. Goodness knows, we&rsquo;ve practiced it
enough. Hi! Blake, they&rsquo;re calling for you to
take your turn with a song. Somebody must
have given them a tip that you&rsquo;ve got Caruso
beaten to a frazzle with that fine tenor voice
you own. So step forward and remember to
do the troop proud every time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blake Merton certainly did have a good
voice, and while somewhat bashful about singing
in the midst of such a large company of
young fellows, he soon got over his timidity.
Indeed, they gave him so warm an ovation
after he had sung once that he arose to the
occasion, and from that time on became the
most popular scout aboard the <i>Vixen</i>. His
services were called for to entertain the crew
every night after discipline had been relaxed
while they sat around on deck enjoying the
salty breeze.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<p>To these boys from inland there was no end
to the new sights and sounds of their first
trip afloat on the briny sea. They enjoyed taking
a salt-water bath whenever the opportunity
arose, drank in the wonderful sight of the
seemingly endless ocean bounded by the horizon,
often on all sides, and in every way possible
sought to get the utmost enjoyment from
this novel experience.</p>
<p>It was still pretty rough outside the next
morning, and the <i>Vixen</i> remained comfortably
anchored behind the point. There were numerous
things to be done that could be carried
out just as well there as at sea. Besides, the
fort against which the Naval Reserve men had
designs was not a great distance up the coast,
so that the plans of the commander called for
caution at this point in the war game.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<p>It was a rather exciting time for the scouts
when they gathered around the wireless operator,
and watched him call the station of Cedar
Hill. It was just at ten o&rsquo;clock, the time
Arthur had promised to be on hand every single
day that it was not storming wildly.</p>
<p>There was more or less vain calling, and
things began to look pretty blue when all at
once there came a response. Every scout knew
that some one was replying to the groping signal
that the operator had sent out through
space; and they only hoped that it might be
their comrade a hundred miles away.</p>
<p>Presently the young operator looked up toward
Hugh and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Old Brutus was poisoned last night
by some mean party unknown!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now every fellow there knew just as well as
anything that the old and faithful watchdog
owned by the Cameron family was named Brutus;
and this little piece of home news convinced
them as nothing else could have done
that they were in communication with Arthur
perched up there at his station on dear old
Cedar Hill.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">118</div>
<p>To most of the boys this method of sending
messages was a complete mystery, but there
were several who had dabbled more or less in
wireless, as some boys have a habit of wanting
to know everything that comes along.</p>
<p>The operator was already aware that Hugh
could send and receive messages after a fashion;
he had talked with the scout master on
several occasions, and even showed him many
little things connected with this special outfit
aboard the <i>Vixen</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He wants to know how you are all getting
on,&rdquo; the obliging operator remarked presently
after another series of flashes and crackling
had announced the receipt of another message.
&ldquo;Suppose you tell him yourself, Mr. Scout
Master?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">119</div>
<p>So Hugh sat down, and with trembling
hands transmitted his answer, the regular operator
gladly assisting him. The boy&rsquo;s confidence
returned when he found that he was
easily able to catch the strange dots and dashes
as utilized in wireless work, and could even
send a short message to far-away Arthur to
the effect that they were all well.</p>
<p>He meant to make use of the code which had
been arranged with Arthur should he have
other opportunities to converse, which seemed
likely. Then Alec asked for the privilege of
exchanging a few words with Arthur, because
he would never have been happy to have missed
the glorious chance of saying he had once
talked from a war vessel over a hundred miles
away from the home town with the scout who
had made his own wireless station.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<p>The boys were allowed shore leave after the
noon hour, being cautioned not to go out of
sight of the boat. They were liable to be signaled
to come aboard almost at any minute,
should the commander decide to steam out of
the harbor and continue the northward cruise.
And with the recollection of what stirring
times were ahead of them, there was little danger
of any scout wandering off. Indeed, all
they really did ashore was to roam the beach,
wade in the shallows, hunt for pretty sea shells,
and keep one eye anxiously fastened on the
anchored <i>Vixen</i>, so as to discover the very first
signal that would be hoisted to tell the boys to
come aboard at once.</p>
<p>The night promised to be fairly dark, at
least sufficiently so to cover the landing of the
scouts from the cruiser. At three o&rsquo;clock the
anchor came up, and they steamed slowly out
of the snug harbor to find that the sea had
gone down, and nothing seemed to be in the
way of making a successful landing when the
proper time had arrived.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">121</div>
<p>Hugh talked the whole thing over again with
the captain, and received his final instructions.
The scouts were each given some food to be
taken along, since it was possible they might
have to remain ashore until the storming party
was put off to creep up the beach and try to
surprise the garrison, who were constantly
on the watch for signs of the enemy in either
direction.</p>
<p>Charts of the coast had been shown the boys,
and Hugh even made a rude map for his own
guidance so that if in doubt he might consult it
and shape his plans accordingly.</p>
<p>Again darkness came, with a young moon
hanging in the western heavens. It would not
set until about ten o&rsquo;clock; and preparations
had been made for sending a boat ashore soon
after that hour containing all the scouts save
Blake Merton, whom Hugh had finally selected
as the receiving end of the signal chain because
he was especially clever at this particular
work.</p>
<p>When they dropped down over the side and
huddled in the boat, the scouts felt their hearts
beating much faster than ordinarily. Of
course it might have been somewhat more exciting
had there been a real enemy to be spied
on instead of just a make-believe one, but for
all that the sensation of having the success or
failure of the whole maneuver depending on
their work gave each boy a feeling of vast importance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>
<p>Almost noiselessly the oars dipped into the
water, and they headed for the shore not more
than a quarter of a mile away from where the
cruiser was anchored. Finally through the
darkness they could begin to distinguish objects
faintly as the trees were outlined against
the sky. Then they entered the gentle surf,
and presently the keel of the boat ran up on the
sand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Steady now, and no hurrying!&rdquo; warned
Hugh softly. The six other scouts proceeded
to clamber out of the boat as silently as they
could, after which it put back to where the one
light aboard the <i>Vixen</i> showed her anchorage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now for a tramp along the beach of a
couple of miles,&rdquo; said Hugh, &ldquo;and remember
there&rsquo;s to be no talking above a whisper. I understand
that the defenders of the fort may
have men out on the watch. Forward now, and
move along like ghosts.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">123</div>
<h2 id="c10">CHAPTER X.
<br /><span class="small">ESTABLISHING THE SIGNAL RELAY.</span></h2>
<p>The seven scouts were soon moving along
the beach, headed north. They quickly lost
sight of the single light aboard the cruiser and
to some of them this seemed like the cutting
of all communications with their allies. From
that time on they must count every one ashore
as an enemy who would betray them if given
half a chance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<p>When two miles or more had probably been
passed over, Hugh began to pay strict attention
to the landmarks as they opened up. The stars
overhead gave abundant light on the beach for
them to see fairly well where they were going.
On the right the soft murmur of the little wavelets
rolling up the pebbly strand, so new a
sound to these lads from the interior, was like
sweet music in their ears. On the left lay
sand dunes that were like great Indian mounds,
and which might conceal any number of spies
should the defenders of the coast fort have
thought it worth while to send them out in
order to keep watch for the coming of the
enemy; Hugh hoped this would not prove to
be the case.</p>
<p>Several times the boys had little scares. An
owl that had been prowling in search of food
close to the water&rsquo;s edge suddenly flew off with
a rush, and went winnowing its way to the
nearby woods. Then a little later on some
small animal scurried away, none of them being
able to identify it positively in the uncertain
light, although Hugh guessed it might
have been a fox that had wandered down in
hopes of picking up something worth eating.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">125</div>
<p>These were small matters, it is true, but
with the nerves of the scouts on edge, as it
were, they served to keep them thrilled with
anticipations of possible discovery. Hugh redoubled
his caution when the second mile had
been passed over. He knew that they were
now getting near the shore front. If by the use
of marine glasses the commander in charge had
been able to pick up the distant <i>Vixen</i> before
the shades of night had enveloped her advance,
he would of course have his men use double
vigilance in order that the fortunes of war
might not be decided against them by the Naval
Reserve capturing his post.</p>
<p>Here was where the knowledge obtained
from the chart on board came in handy for
Hugh. He was able at any time to know just
where they had arrived, and to understand the
situation ahead.</p>
<p>The scouts were now advancing very slowly,
bringing into use many of the little tricks they
had learned when playing the Indian game in
the woods. It was easy work making their
way along the open beach. Hugh had now
taken them away from the water so as to secure
more or less protection from the trees further
back. Here they felt more at home, and the
forward movement was kept up steadily, minute
after minute.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<p>Then finally the scout master discovered that
just ahead of them there lay a peculiar formation
of rocks. It ran all the way down to the
water, and further out, until lost to sight under
the sea. This line of ragged rocks had all the
characteristics of a reef, only that it did not
agree with the conformation of the coast as
most reefs do.</p>
<p>Here was the place that had been selected for
the clever work of the signal corps on the morrow.
The scouts were to hide amidst these
rocks until dawn allowed the leaders to spy
upon the fort with the field glasses they had
brought along for the purpose.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">127</div>
<p>An hour or so before daybreak three of their
number were to start back along the beach to
take up positions which had been pointed out
by the scout master while they were making
their advance. These were to remain constantly
on the watch for any signals which
might come in the shape of the semaphore alphabet,
wigwag work, or through the use of a
piece of broken mirror, with which each fellow
had been armed before leaving the ship,
and which, in case of the sun shining, was to
be used as a means of sending messages along
the line.</p>
<p>Should Hugh deem it safe to wave the white
flag with its red square in the center, he would
expect that method to be put in practice, but as
this would mean more or less exposure on the
beach, possibly it could not be used.</p>
<p>It was with more or less thankfulness that he
led his scouts into the clump of rocks where
they meant to make themselves as comfortable
as the conditions would allow. Here they
could move around even after day came, so long
as they kept themselves from being seen by
those in the fort. Doubtless, the garrison
would have numerous duties to perform, and
beyond keeping a fairly smart lookout for
signs of an advancing suspicious vessel, it
would not go to any further trouble.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">128</div>
<p>It was far from comfortable, though, sitting
on those hard rocks, but the boys made themselves
believe that they were enjoying themselves
hugely. They could only converse in
whispers, and Hugh even cautioned them
against doing too much of this, so that the time
hung heavy on their hands.</p>
<p>As they had all had considerable experience
in roughing it at various times, they finally settled
down in the softest places they could find
near together, and managed to secure some
sleep, though it came in what Billy termed &ldquo;cat
naps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hugh himself did not expect to get any rest.
The whole success or failure of the enterprise
depended pretty much upon him. At least he
would be held responsible for any lapse that
spelled defeat for the bold mariners from the
<i>Vixen</i>, when they attempted on another night
to get close to the fort in order that they could
command its unconditional surrender with the
coming of dawn.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">129</div>
<p>So the anxious scout master kept moving
about much of the time. He would crawl to a
certain spot he had selected near the crest of
the ridge of rocks, and from which he was able
to see the lights of the fort. Here he expected
in the morning to take observations through his
powerful glasses, and when the sun was suitable
transmit any important intelligence he had
gleaned along to the scout next in line. In
turn the latter would pass it on until finally
it was received aboard the war vessel by Blake
Merton, the entire work having been done by
scouts.</p>
<p>Midnight came and went with all being well.</p>
<p>By now the other fellows seemed to have
sunk into a sound sleep, and this impressed
Hugh so much that he tried his best to follow
their example. But the excitement under
which he labored was so intense that while he
secured some comfort from stretching out at
full length and closing his eyes, not for a single
minute was he able to forget himself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">130</div>
<p>Long practice in camping out in the woods at
night had enabled Hugh to tell successfully
what the time might be from observing the
stars in their never-ceasing march toward the
western horizon. When the young moon went
down it had been a few minutes after ten. That
was nearly three hours ago, as it must now be
close on one o&rsquo;clock. As daylight could not be
looked for until somewhere near half-past four
he knew there were still three more hours for
him to lie around, first on one side until that
felt sore, and then turning on the other for a
change.</p>
<p>When another hour had passed Hugh
aroused three of the scouts, these being the
fellows who were to take up their stations as
arranged on the back trail, and relay each message
as it came along. Perhaps there was
really little necessity for doing this, but Hugh
believed in making things doubly sure. If one
of the signal senders failed to receive properly
the message, the next in line would likely have
read it correctly, and could relay it on.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">131</div>
<p>There was another hour or so to wait after
Sam, Walter and Billy had been dispatched to
their posts. Hugh allowed the rest to sleep on.
He stood watch, and cast many anxious glances
toward the east where the first faint flush of
dawn would finally make itself manifest.</p>
<p>He knew that the <i>Vixen</i> would have slipped
her anchor, and gone further down the coast
before then, to take up a new anchorage at a
place where the conformation of the land promised
to hide her presence from the watchers at
the fort. The scout who was located at the
most southerly station would thus still be in
position to communicate with those aboard.</p>
<p>Once Hugh had been greatly tempted to sally
forth under cover of darkness, and approach
closer to the unseen fort, urged by the impression
that he might be lucky enough to pick up
valuable information in some fashion.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">132</div>
<p>On second thought, however, he decided that
his orders did not contemplate any such rash
movement. If in taking such a hazard he were
discovered and made a prisoner of war, of
course all hope of taking the garrison by surprise
must be abandoned, and the game would
go against the Naval Reserve men.</p>
<p>Hugh had learned how scout law meant implicit
compliance with orders, and that under
such conditions nothing should be attempted
beyond the bare reading of the duties as set
forth by the commanding officer. He must
crush down any temptation looking to self-elevation,
and the desire to engage in an adventure
for the sake of enjoying the thrill it might
entail.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">133</div>
<p>How slowly the minutes dragged along!
Hugh did not remember of ever before being in
a position where he almost counted the passing
seconds. But it could not be for long, and before
daylight came he expected to have the balance
of his little band scattered among the
rocks. In this way they would run small
chances of discovery, even though officers or
men from the fort took a notion to cross over
to the land reef for some purpose or other during
the day.</p>
<p>He had just aroused Alec, Monkey Stallings
and Don Miller by a gentle touch and whispered
words when he plainly heard the crunch
of heavy footfalls approaching.</p>
<p>Whoever it might be, the fact that he was
coming from the direction of the unseen fort,
and would likely cross the rocky reef just at
the point where they happened to be crouching,
made matters look serious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will have to capture him, most likely!&rdquo;
Hugh whispered again, for he knew that if
they started to creep away there was already
enough light with the coming of dawn for them
to be seen.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">134</div>
<p>It was supposed that every member of the
Coast Artillery in charge of the fortifications
beyond knew the rules by which these mock
attacks are governed. If they suddenly confronted
this enemy, and made a demand for
his surrender he must immediately elevate his
hands, and refrain from trying to call out so as
to warn his comrades of the impending peril.
That was one of the rules to be strictly observed
on both sides. It meant that the man
had unwittingly placed himself in a position
where his capture or death at the hands of the
hidden foeman could have been easily accomplished,
and therefore he must eliminate himself
from subsequent events just as though his
life had indeed been sacrificed.</p>
<p>Hugh, however, thought that they would do
better to leap suddenly upon the other, and get
him down before demanding that he surrender.
They were only boys, to be sure, but four to
one is pretty heavy odds; and besides they
would have all the advantage that comes of a
surprise.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">135</div>
<p>Nearer came the crunching footsteps.
Plainly the party did not seem anxious to take
any one unawares, for he walked as though
wearing heavy sea boots. Now he was ascending
the reef, and the night air blew a whiff of
tobacco smoke from his pipe to the nostrils of
the crouching scouts. They saw his head, surmounted
by a fisherman&rsquo;s sou&rsquo;easter hat rise
above the ridge, and then he walked straight
into their extended arms.</p>
<p>They sprang on him furiously, and Alec,
catching his leg adroitly in that of the unknown,
by a movement along the jiu-jitsu order
as practiced by the Japanese, managed to
throw the man over, with every one of the boys
clinging to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surrender!&rdquo; hissed Hugh, as he poked the
man in the ribs with a shell he had picked up.
&ldquo;Not a sound above a whisper, you hear?
You&rsquo;re a prisoner of war, and held in the hands
of the enemy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gosh all hemlock! whatever does this here
mean?&rdquo; gurgled the fallen man; and when he
heard him speak, Hugh knew their prisoner
was not an artilleryman, but a lobster catcher.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">136</div>
<h2 id="c11">CHAPTER XI.
<br /><span class="small">A TEMPTATION AND A VICTORY.</span></h2>
<p>The four scouts were all sitting on their
prisoner, and Alec Sands was feeling around
the man&rsquo;s throat as though half tempted to try
to shut off his wind if he manifested any inclination
to shout. But the captive seemed to
be so overcome with surprise that he could
only express his feelings in that short sentence
ending the last chapter.</p>
<p>Quick to think, Hugh realized that he must
enter into some sort of explanation if he wished
to save the day. This fisherman was not supposed
to be in the confidence of the fort&rsquo;s commander
and would know next to nothing about
the rules governing the great landing game. At
the same time if they allowed him to get away
he might betray them to those who were defending
the shore batteries.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">137</div>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo; he asked shortly, in a
tense whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bige Quick!&rdquo; came the ready reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a fisherman?&rdquo; Hugh said next.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I got some lobster traps out yonder, boss,&rdquo;
answered the man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you were going out to make your regular
morning visit to the crawls&mdash;is that right,
Bige?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what I calkerlated on doing as
soon as sun-up kim erlong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you can&rsquo;t go this morning, Bige,&rdquo;
continued Hugh. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll tell you why. We
belong on board a Government war vessel, and
there&rsquo;s one of those war games on right now,
you see? The Coast Artillery are manning the
fort, and they&rsquo;ve defied the jackies to get close
enough to demand their surrender. We expect
to hang out here all day, and you&rsquo;ll have
to give us your promise that you&rsquo;ll act with us.
For letting your lobster pots go till to-morrow
I&rsquo;ll promise you a five-dollar bill. Swear to
stand by us, and act just as though you belonged
on board the scout cruiser <i>Vixen</i>. Understand
all that, do you, Bige?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">138</div>
<p>&ldquo;Reckon as haow I do, Mister,&rdquo; replied the
man cheerfully, as it began to dawn on his
mind that he had stumbled on great luck at the
peep of dawn, since he could not make that
much money half as easy by attending to his
lobster pots.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you give us your solemn promise to
stick by us through thick and thin, and not try
to get away at any time?&rdquo; the scout master
went on to say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yuh kin count on me bein&rsquo; with yuh, Mister.
I ain&rsquo;t got any too much love for the
sojers naow in thet fort. Every day they keep
abangin&rsquo; away with them big guns, till nigh all
the chiny we got tuh hum hes been broke.
&rsquo;Sides thet, hang the luck, if they ain&rsquo;t sot their
old target nigh bout over where I hes my lobster
pots. Skeered &rsquo;bout all the fish away sense
they kim up here, they has. I give yuh my solemn
promise, and I sure hopes as haow yuh
captures the hull shebang. Mebbe then they&rsquo;ll
clear aout, an&rsquo; leave honest fishermen tuh their
business.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">139</div>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Bige, we&rsquo;ll call it a bargain,&rdquo; said
Hugh, as he reached for the big fist of the
prostrate coast dweller. &ldquo;Get up, boys. No
need of sitting on him any longer. Bige is one
of us from now on. I&rsquo;ll explain some of the
things to him while we hide among the rocks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After all, the seeming difficulty had turned
out to be a blessing in disguise; they had gained
a recruit who might be useful to them in many
ways.</p>
<p>Hugh managed to let considerable light in on
Bige Quick&rsquo;s mind as they lay hidden awaiting
signs of life at the fort. In return the lobster
fisherman told him not a few valuable
things about the habits of the Coast Artillery,
all of which Hugh soaked in, with an eye to
making the knowledge useful later on.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">140</div>
<p>They were close enough to the fort to see the
sentries walking up and down, and when the
breeze proved favorable they could even hear
loud voices at times, for close to the sea, the air
was a good conductor of sound.</p>
<p>When they knew the garrison must be at
breakfast, the boys bethought them of the
cooked food they had carried along in their
haversacks. So Hugh gave the order that they
should break their fast, which every one proceeded
to do, according to his fancy. They
even fed Bige, having an abundance of eatables
along&mdash;trust boys for looking out to this end
when allowed to stock up of their own accord,
for they know how a fellow&rsquo;s appetite may
stretch.</p>
<p>Hugh crept up to his lookout to use his glass
cautiously. Bige had assured him that seldom
did any of the garrison venture to walk along
the beach in the direction of the rocky reef;
they had too many things to do each day connected
with the manning of the defensive coast
works, and the firing of the big disappearing
guns.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">141</div>
<p>About ten o&rsquo;clock the first heavy detonation
told that they were at their business, and at
long intervals until nearly noon the boys were
almost deafened by the cannonading. They
could understand that the work must be progressing
favorably, since hearty cheers often
followed the discharge. Hugh might have
noted where each projectile struck only that
he could not change his position without some
danger of being seen, and he was there for a
different purpose than that of marking the hits
and misses of the Coast Defense Artillery.</p>
<p>He had mapped out his plans, and knew how
the jackies aboard the <i>Vixen</i> could surprise the
defenders of the fort, once they received his
instructions as to how to proceed up the shore.
He had closely examined every spot with his
glass, and felt positive that they did not have
any videttes posted below the rocks; doubtless
they depended entirely on their lookouts on the
ramparts to discover the first signs of a hostile
ship either to the south or the north.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">142</div>
<p>It was now high time, while the garrison still
kept up their exciting gun practice, to get in
touch with those aboard the scout cruiser. So
Hugh set himself to work to manage this.</p>
<p>He kept his glass handy, that he might detect
the least evidence tending to show that
their presence was suspected. At the same
time he wrote out a short sentence in cipher,
which he gave to the other boys to transmit.</p>
<p>The sun was shining brightly, and the conditions
were as nearly perfect as they could
be for heliograph work, if only it could be
managed that the next relay station might pick
up the messages without those in the fort being
any the wiser.</p>
<p>It required careful treatment, but Alec and
Don were skillful manipulators of the mirror,
and could send the quick flashes in a way that
would not be seen at the other side of the
rocky reef, which acted as a friendly barrier.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">143</div>
<p>Alec quickly reported that he was in communication
with the next station. Then the
scout master gave the order for the first message
to be sent along. It was going to take
some little time to manage all this; but the
code simplified matters, since a single sign frequently
stood for a whole sentence.</p>
<p>When the next station gave the pleasing
information that it had all been correctly received
and sent along the line, Hugh felt that
things were certainly progressing splendidly.
And it may be mentioned that the rough lobster
fisherman was watching all this wonderful
work with open mouth and staring eyes; it had
never occurred before to him that people could
&ldquo;talk&rdquo; while many miles apart with only a
piece of broken looking-glass and the sun&rsquo;s
bright rays to assist them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">144</div>
<p>So far all had gone well. Hugh could detect
no sign in the region of the hostile fort
to indicate that suspicion had been aroused.
Nevertheless he did not mean to send a single
unnecessary word along the relay line, since
it would be taking needless chances of discovery.</p>
<p>What he told the commander of the scout
cruiser was that if he landed a force of jackies
they could come up the shore safely by keeping
back of the scrub, and being careful not to
show themselves even once. He knew only
too well that the white suits of the Naval Reserve
men would be instantly spotted by the
glasses of those who were watching all through
the livelong day for the first token of a hostile
force in the vicinity.</p>
<p>Three different short messages did Hugh
send. They took upwards of an hour to move
along; and when the last sign had been given,
to tell the next station on the south that the
signaling was done, Hugh breathed a sigh of
relief.</p>
<p>So far as he knew all was well. He could
see nothing unusual going on in the fort, where
the men were evidently getting their midday
meal, and strict discipline must have been relaxed
for a spell, since snatches of laughter
and even of song came floating to his ears.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">145</div>
<p>He lay there counting the minutes, wondering
how long it would take the men from the
cruiser to arrive. Again and again did Hugh
turn his glasses backward and survey the beach
as far as he could see it. Orders had gone
forth that the natives should keep away from
the vicinity of the fort as much as possible during
the two weeks when the Coast Artillery
manned the same for their annual practice with
the big guns. This would account for the fact
that the beach seemed quite deserted as far
south as he could see.</p>
<p>But then Hugh did not expect to catch any
glimpse of the coming force. If they were
unwise enough to show themselves so that he
could discover them, what would hinder the
sharp-eyed videttes on the ramparts of the fort
from doing the same, since they had been
posted there with instructions to report the
least suspicious sign in any direction?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">146</div>
<p>The other boys were taking things easy according
to their several notions of what constituted
comfort. Had Billy been present, his
idea would have run along the line of a nice
nap, for sleeping was one of Billy&rsquo;s strong
points. Alec, Don and Monkey Stallings were
more inclined to spy on the enemy than do
anything else. Several times Alec gave a quick
glance toward Hugh. He seemed to be struggling
with something that was gripping him
pretty hard, and apparently fighting an inward
battle.</p>
<p>The truth of the matter was that Alec had
made an important discovery, and at the same
time a terrible temptation had come upon him.
By the merest accident in the world he had
sighted a couple of officers from the fort approaching
the reef from an angle that was
really beyond Hugh&rsquo;s range of vision. No one
else had as yet seen them but Alec. If he remained
silent, the chances were that they must
presently discover the figures of the scouts
crouching among the rocks, taking them by
surprise as it were.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">147</div>
<p>Well, such a thing would spell the ruin of
the game, from the standpoint of the Naval
Reservists. At the same time the failure of
the plan was bound to give the young scout
master a black mark.</p>
<p>Perhaps after making a failure of this important
game, Hugh might feel it incumbent
to resign his position as assistant scout master
of the troop; or the boys on their part might
request his stepping down into the ranks. That
would mean the elevation of Alec to the proud
post he aspired to fill!</p>
<p>The temptation was very strong for a brief
time. Alec hardly breathed, and had observers
been watching the boy they would have seen
that his hands opened and shut many times
almost fiercely. In fact it was one of the
greatest crises that would ever come into his
young life; and much depended on the result.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">148</div>
<p>Perhaps his better nature arose to denounce
any such treacherous action for which he could
find no excuse whatever. Possibly, too, he
looked back to that time when Hugh and he
had been up on the side of old Stormberg
Mountain, and he sprained his ankle so that
he could not walk; when instead of deserting
him, that loyal comrade had taken him on his
back and carried him much of the way, until
he could limp along with his arm around
Hugh&rsquo;s neck.</p>
<p>Then and there the victory was won. Alec
gritted his teeth hard together and his eyes
flashed fire. With the resolution to do his full
duty as a true blue scout, he crept over to where
Hugh lay, and communicated his important
discovery to the other. Of course after that,
the four boys, together with the raw recruit,
Bige Quick, found places of concealment. The
two officers sat down on the rocks not twenty
feet away, discussing all manner of matters
of interest connected with the occupation of
the fort and their readiness to anticipate any
attack, not once up to the time they moved off
suspecting that enemies hovered near by.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">149</div>
<h2 id="c12">CHAPTER XII.
<br /><span class="small">WITH THE BATTLESHIP SQUADRON.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;No sign of the jackies yet, Chief?&rdquo; asked
Don Miller when another half hour had crept
by and the afternoon was well on its way.</p>
<p>The boys had emerged from their places of
concealment after the artillery officers departed,
and from time to time the scout master
made good use of his glasses, either to observe
what was going on around the fort or else
to scrutinize the shore to the south.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was just going to tell you,&rdquo; began Hugh,
&ldquo;that there&rsquo;s some reason to believe they&rsquo;re
coming right now. I caught a flash from the
next station, and you remember the boys had
orders to signal us in case the force from the
cruiser came along. Hold out for another half
hour and perhaps something will happen.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">150</div>
<p>&ldquo;Whee! I&rsquo;m glad to hear you say so, Chief,&rdquo;
whispered Monkey Stallings, who was evidently
having a harder time keeping quiet than
any of his chums because of his restless nature.</p>
<p>Slowly the minutes dragged along. Occasionally
one of the boys would believe he had
caught some slight motion in the bushes below.
Imagination, however, must have magnified
the movements of a rabbit or some other
small animal into the cautious advance of a
human being, for none of them really saw
any one until there came creeping toward them
from the nearby bushes a figure that they
recognized as belonging to Sam Winter.</p>
<p>Behind him came a second scout in khaki,
none other than Walter Osborne, and as Hugh
saw still a third, who turned out to be Billy,
he understood that the column from the cruiser
must be at hand.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">151</div>
<p>Sure enough the white-clad jackies came
trailing along, some even getting down on
their stomachs in order not to be discovered
by the videttes walking the ramparts of the
nearby shore fort.</p>
<p>One by one they came with several leading
officers in charge until the whole space back
of the friendly rocky reef was peppered with
uniformed Reservists, to the great wonderment
of Bige Quick, who crouched there thinking
it the strangest sight he had ever laid eyes
on. No doubt he would also believe that to be
the easiest five-dollar bill he had ever earned
in all his life, when Hugh paid it over as agreed
upon.</p>
<p>Everything was now ready for the surprise.
They had reached a striking distance of the
fort without being discovered. All that remained
was for them to notify the artillerists
who had been caught napping that they were
prisoners of war, according to the rules of the
game. And great would be the glory accorded
the navy for having played their part
so successfully. The Boy Scouts would of
course come in for their share of the honors,
and nothing would be too good for the eight
aboard the <i>Vixen</i> during the remainder of that
memorable cruise.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">152</div>
<p>At a given signal the rocks swarmed with
men in white uniforms, and as a bugle pealed
out, hearty cheers announced that the navy
had sprung a tremendous surprise upon the
army. This, following the well-won victory of
the navy football team only the preceding
Thanksgiving, when the army was humbled in
the dust, would convince many scoffers that
one arm of the Government service seemed to
be just at that time vastly superior to the
other.</p>
<p>Although the defenders of the fort were
very much shocked at the ease with which an
enemy had been enabled to creep up and capture
their stronghold, doubtless it served as a
lasting warning to them in the future. They
soon recovered from their feeling of chagrin,
and welcomed the naval men with open arms.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">153</div>
<p>While men and officers were fraternizing,
Hugh, at the wish of the commander of the
expedition, made good use of the mirror again.
Getting into communication with Blake Merton
aboard the <i>Vixen</i>, hidden behind that cape of
land that jutted out so conveniently, he forwarded
orders that the scout cruiser should
steam up the coast and embark the shore expedition
later on in the day.</p>
<p>And when they finally did go aboard, after
having formally received the surrender of the
fort in order to complete the war game, they
were a jolly lot of jackies, for success always
warms the heart and brings smiles to the face.</p>
<p>The Boy Scouts had by this time become
greater favorites than ever. The splendid
manner in which Hugh and his comrades had
played their parts in spying on the enemy and
relaying the information they had succeeded
in accumulating until it was received aboard,
had quite won all hearts.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">154</div>
<p>When torpedo practice came along again,
they were given every opportunity to observe
the clever manner in which the deadly missile
was discharged through the tube, and to join
in the cheers that announced when a hit had
been made, although of course the whitehead
torpedo had not been charged for explosion.</p>
<p>Other features of the cruise consisted of
certain maneuvers in connection with the
North Atlantic Squadron of battleships, then
first starting in for their late summer gun
practice at sea off Portsmouth. Greatly to
the delight of the boys they were given an
opportunity to observe some of this big gun
shooting, in which the gunners acquitted themselves
so creditably as to beat all previous records.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">155</div>
<p>As the commander had promised should be
the case as a reward for their services in helping
capture the hostile fort, Hugh and his
mates were allowed to have possession of the
wireless for a certain length of time almost
every day. What messages those boys did
send home, each of them being determined
that there should be preserved in the family
archives a record of a true wireless message
sent by the son of the house from aboard a
Government war vessel cruising along the
coast.</p>
<p>In return the eager operator up at the tree
station on Cedar Hill told them all the latest
gossip of the home town, understanding how
anxious those eight exiles would be getting by
this time for news that concerned their neighbors
and friends.</p>
<p>They learned much during those never-to-be-forgotten
days aboard the gallant <i>Vixen</i>.
Each setting sun was viewed with deep regret
as marking one day less for their wonderful
vacation. And many times did Hugh and the
rest declare that the first thing they meant to
do upon arriving at home was to send a hearty
vote of thanks to Professor Perkins for having
been instrumental in securing them this
undreamed-of happiness.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">156</div>
<p>&ldquo;And forever after this I&rsquo;m going to keep
my eye aloft when out on a hike, in hopes of
another balloon coming along, where the aeronaut
will require a helping hand! It surely
pays better than anything I ever ran across
before,&rdquo; was the way Billy expressed his feelings
in the matter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lightning never strikes in the same place
twice, Billy, they say,&rdquo; Hugh told him, &ldquo;but
it&rsquo;s just as well to keep your eyes open all the
time, because you never know when you may
happen to run across a good thing. Besides,
a scout is supposed to be wideawake and on
the alert. I was wondering whether Arthur
has found time to print those copies of the
dancing bear, Jumbo, that he promised us.
Next time we get in touch with the Cedar Hill
Wireless Station I mean to ask him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">157</div>
<p>&ldquo;At the same time will you ask if the Russian
got well enough to go up after his hidden
money so that he could start across the
sea for his home land?&rdquo; asked Alec, who had
taken considerable interest in the affair, even
though fortune had not allowed him to be one
of those connected with the rescue of the
wounded owner of the hungry bear.</p>
<p>Hugh remembered this, and greatly to his
delight Arthur managed to tell, by using their
condensing code, of course, how he had actually
accompanied the foreigner, at the request
of the latter, to get his secreted money, which
showed what confidence the poor fellow now
placed in every boy who wore that significant
khaki uniform.</p>
<p>The man had succeeded in finding the secret
<i>cache</i> which he had been aiming to reach on
that day when he slipped and fell over the
fatal little precipice. And by the time Hugh
took this message, the Russian was probably
outside of Boston harbor bound homeward.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">158</div>
<p>All this home news, with much else connected
with their girl and boy friends, as well as the
love sent by parents and brothers and sisters,
was eagerly received by the eight exiles. They
cudgeled their brains trying to think up the
most important messages to send back to Arthur
<i>via</i> wireless; and Hugh had to cull out
many as impossible to transmit in the limited
time allowed them for their use of the apparatus,
considering the slow receiving capacity
of the scout on Cedar Hill.</p>
<p>So day followed day and each one seemed
to bring new experiences to the boys who accompanied
the Naval Reserve men along the
coast. Once they met with quite a lively
storm, and some of the scouts even feared
they might never see the dear ones at home
again, but good management on the part of
those who had charge of the vessel averted the
danger.</p>
<p>Then there was a baffling experience
with the dense fog that came drifting down
from the Banks. There the warm water of the
Gulf Stream meets with the colder currents of
air from the region of perpetual ice and snow,
causing vapor to form almost every day in the
year.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">159</div>
<p>No accident occurred during the hours in
which the <i>Vixen</i> was shrouded in fog, but they
heard the fog horns sounding, and the heavy
whistle that told of a liner off her course.</p>
<p>Finally the time came when the <i>Vixen</i> had
to return to port, as the vacations of the jackies
aboard had about expired, and most of
them would have to buckle down to business
again, much to their regret.</p>
<p>Hugh and his seven comrades took train
for the home town, feeling that their experience
with the Naval Reserve on their annual
cruise had been a most valuable lesson all
around, and one which had brought them new
laurels as well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was the greatest time ever,&rdquo; sighed
Billy as he and Hugh watched from the car the
familiar landscape fly past as they drew near
home. &ldquo;And chances are we&rsquo;ll none of us ever
have such a glorious opportunity again.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">160</div>
<p>Hugh did not answer, for truth to tell Billy
was voicing his own sentiments when he said
this. Yet how little could they see ahead!
Even at that very minute events were shaping
themselves so as to bring about another combination
that was likely to afford certain of
the scouts yet another wonderful experience
in a new field that none of them had ever
dreamed of occupying. Just what that might
be it would hardly seem fair to tell at this late
point in the story. For the benefit of those
readers who have become interested in the fortunes
of Hugh Hardin and his chums, it ought
to be enough to say that their further
adventures will be continued in the next volume
of this Series under the title of &ldquo;The Boy
Scouts in the Saddle.&rdquo;</p>
